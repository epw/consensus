Aaron - obviously, and I except a fair amount of hesitancy from him, but still really want to hear.
Janna - she has trouble understanding, uh, Things, but when she gets it, it goes deep. She's never thought of herself as a Mage, would be very interesting
Sarah Lynn Bowman - I'm sure she'd occur to you too, and is pie-in-the-sky, but, you know, wouldn't it be cool if she read it this early?
William Nicholas - (one of my Avatars from Epiphany) knows Mage, I value his opinion on things, we're still vaguely in contact
Pavis - Look I like my Avatars, OK?
Becky - we'll probably mostly get "I'm bitter I don't play more RPGs" but she has real insight
Brian Ellis - much like Aaron, especially because he's been playing his own game, but I bet it will be pretty valuable. Maybe we should ask for him (maybe some of his players?) to fill out the survey for "their games so far"? Might be an interesting baseline
Jono - Really likes Consensus
Steph - We've never been able to communicate that well but also connected with Consensus to some degree, and it would be weird to only ask one of them for feedback unless things have majorly changed I'm unaware of

Category: everyone we've played a campaign with who I'm thus not bothering to list here
Category: other interesting names in the indie RPG and PbtA space????

Big thing this is missing is even remotely diverse viewpoints. I know a lot of that will need to involve paid work to, essentially, strangers, but if there's anyone we have a more direct contact with that I'm missing, then whether it would make sense to pay them or not, I'd want to get them in the first wave.
