\renewcommand{\PaneFive}{\SECTION{Your Cabal:}

  By default there are about 5 in the Cabal, you don't control them
  and they don't control you. You're pretty close in your outlooks on
  the world, but not everything lines up completely. This is a small
  cabal, with weak magic.

  Pick up to two of these:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You actually are in charge, or at least you founded it. 
    Strength: +loyal
  \item There's more than just a couple of you, maybe 10 or
    more. Medium cabal.
  \item You're part of a larger system, you're just one node in the
    leylines. Strength: +support
  \item Your cabal is strong of will. Drop weak magic
  \item Your cabal is very close. Strength: +family 
  \end{itemize}

  And pick one of these:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Your cabal doesn't keep a super low profile. Vulnerable:
    Target
  \item Your cabal owes something to someone, money, allegiance, an
    artifact, or the like. Vulnerable: Obligation
  \item Your cabal is anonymous and guarded about their
    identities. Vulnerable: Infiltration
