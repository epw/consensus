\SECTION{The Principles}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Riddle the world with hidden magic, unexpected connections, and
  unrecognized potential
\item Address yourself to the characters, not the players
\item Make your move, but misdirect
\item Make your move, but never speak its name
\item Look down the sights
\item Name everyone, make everyone human
\item Ask provocative questions, build on the answers
\item Sometimes, give them exactly what they’re asking for
\item Be a fan of the players' characters
\item Think offscreen too
\item Sometimes, declaim decision-making
\item {\large\bf Don't be afraid to be obvious!}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\SECTION{Your Moves}
\begin{itemize}
\item Make them Backlash
\item Deal damage
\item Assign Discord
\item Add a Restriction to a Mage’s Paradigm
\item Adjust a Status Track
\item Capture someone
\item Take away their stuff
\item Change the Battlefield
\bigskip
\item Turn their move back on them
\item Announce off-screen badness
\item Make a Front move \textit{(from one of your Fronts)}
\item Separate them
\item Hit them with the static realities of their world
\bigskip
\item Threaten an Anchor
\item Introduce a Lookout
\item Raise the Stakes
\item Put someone in a spot
\item Show them the downsides of their Paradigm
\item Make them Conjure or Buy
\item Slip a Status
\item Pit their desires against each other
\item Reveal an unwelcome truth

\item Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost
\item Tell them the possible consequences and ask
\item After every move: ``what do you do?''
\end{itemize}
\columnbreak

\SECTION{Scene-Framing Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pick 2-3 people, tell them where they are, make a soft move, and
  ask them why they're there
\end{itemize}
