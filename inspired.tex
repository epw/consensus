\renewcommand{\Moves}{
\DEFAULTMOVE{Source}{You've identified the source of your inspiration,
  and it lifts you up. Take +1 ongoing while your source is present.}

\MOVE{Just When I Think You're Gone}{When you \TRIGGER{pass up an
    opportunity to interact with your Source of Inspiration}, roll
  +Grace. On a hit, hold 1. On a 10+ you may spend your hold 1 for 1
  to have your source appear in the scene with no explanation
  needed. On a 7-9 you may spend your hold for the same, but your
  Source is threatened, captured, or in peril.}

\MOVE{Open Their Mind}{When you \TRIGGER{introduce an individual to
    your Source to open their mind}, roll +Charm. On a 10+, they are
  not a lookout the next time they would be for your magic. On a 7-9,
  they are drawn to your Source (if a PC, they mark experience next
  time they interact with your Source). On a 6-, in addition to
  whatever else the GM says, choose one:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
  \item They find they have a strong aversion to your Source
  \item They wish to take your Source away from you.
  \end{itemize}
}

\MOVE{Opiate for the Masses}{When you \TRIGGER{bring your Source to a
    mob}, roll +Grace. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your
  hold 1-for-1 to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
  \item Discover a truth that they know
  \item Obtain something of value or use
  \item Get them to believe a truth
  \item Learn their potential
  \item Placate them and return them to their mundane lives
  \end{itemize}
}

\MOVE{Visions of Fate}{When you \TRIGGER{dive into the chaos
    surging around you to see visions of what could come to be}, roll
  +Body. On a 10+, pick one person who keeps their standing, and one
  who doesn't. On a 7-9, pick one or the other. Don't name a PC; name
  NPCs only. The MC will make your prediction come true, if it's even
  remotely possible. On a miss, take -1 ongoing until the chaos
  subsides.}

}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMoveSpacing}{1em}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMove}{roll +Charm. On a hit you count as
  having Opened Their Mind, as if you'd rolled a 10+. On a 7-9 they
  hold 1, and can spend that hold to have your Source show up in a
  scene, or deny it from you for a scene. On a 6-, if they are aware
  of the magical world, they gain a restriction against magic with
  your Source.}

  Time-Affecting magic}{Choose one: Magic that reinforces the status
  quo, Magic that doesn’t Protect my Source}{Choose this one: Magic
