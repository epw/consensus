if you need to insert a "blank" in a playbook anchor, use 6 underscores

for page break, type \pagebreak on its own line, with one blank line above and one below
for new page, type \newpage on its own line, with one blank line above and one below

for links, type {{linkThe Text You Want to Link}}, this will link in html, and append (page xx) in pdf
for anchors, type {{anchorThe Same Text From Your Link}}, on its own line, with one blank line above and one below, this will be invisible in both views (For some reason this appears to fail in windows Notepad++, but work when the space is added in ubuntu textedit)

for removing paragraph indenting for a block, type \setlength{\parindent}{0em} on its own line with one blank line above and one below. Type \setlength{\parindent}{1em} on its own line with one blank line above and one below, to return it to its normal value after the block.
