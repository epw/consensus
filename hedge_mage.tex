\renewcommand{\Moves}{
  \DEFAULTMOVE{Exactly When I Mean To}{At the \TRIGGER{beginning of the session}, roll +Entropic. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7â€“9, hold 1. At any time, either you or the MC can spend your hold to have you arrive in a scene, with the proper tools and knowledge, with or without any clear explanation why. Take +1 forward when you do so. On a miss, the MC holds 1, and can spend it to have you arrive, but somehow pinned, caught or trapped.}

\MOVE{Call Through Shadow}{When you \TRIGGER{call a mundane or common object to yourself}, roll +Dynamic. On a hit, you have successfully summoned it to you. On a 10+ you're in the clear. On a 7-9 choose 1:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item It comes out of an intense nearby situation
\item It comes with strings attached
\item It can be traced back to you.\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{Scrying Bowl}{When you have an object related to a person and use it to \TRIGGER{gaze upon their current situation}, roll +Without. On a 10+ all 3, on a 7-9 choose 1:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item They don't know they're being watched
\item You can identify where they are
\item You can discern what they are doing.\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{If You Ask Me}{When you \TRIGGER{offer an alternative perspective on someone's Paradigm}, roll +Without. On a hit, they gain experience. On a 10+, give them a new Aligned related to what you told them until the end of session.}

\MOVE{Magical Experimentation}{When you collaborate with other Mages to \TRIGGER{push your magic past its current boundaries} in a controlled setting, roll +Dynamic. On a 10+ all 3, on a 7-9 choose 1:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item It works pretty much as intended
\item It doesn't cause a scene, draw extra attention, or harm you
\item It was controlled enough that you can repeat it.\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{This One Is Mine}{When you \TRIGGER{call out another magical being}, so long as your companions don't interfere, others will give you enough space to finish it, come what may.}
