<h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>


<h2 id="paradigm-1">Paradigm</h2>


<h3 id="title">Title</h3>

<h3 id="aligned">Aligned</h3>
<p>Aligned aspects are parts of the Paradigm that the Mage is particularly good at. This may have to do with their beliefs (a Mage who believes in a current of life energy flowing through the Universe is likely to be good at healing), or just be a particular focus within what’s possible (a Mage who believes that Reality can be programmed might have happened to have specialized in deletion, out of a variety of possibilities.) Use the listed choices in Aligned for a sense of what the Paradigm can likely do.</p>
<p>Your character’s Aligned aspect makes it easier to help related actions, and magic which is Aligned to your character’s Paradigm has a chance of being particularly, remarkably successful.</p>
<h3 id="opposed">Opposed</h3>
<p>Opposed aspects are things which your Mage believes are impossible, as firmly as you probably believe that the Sun rises each day. These will never apply to anything which a non-Mage could do, but definitely can cover things which other Mages may do. The even may apply to things your own Mage might appear to be capable of. Having them listed under Opposed means that there is a detail to the Mage’s Paradigm that completely precludes them. For example, if a Mage has “emotional manipulation” as an Opposed aspect, then that means that they do not think it fits into their worldview. If the worldview looks very broad and flexible, like “Ancient Languages Hold Secret Power,” then there is a reason it is Opposed. Perhaps the language came from before humans were evolved enough to manipulate emotions, rather than just feel and express them like animals. Perhaps it was too dangerous and was sealed away by an ancient Mage. Or perhaps it is unknown to the Mage, they just have a deep sense that it is impossible as continuing to live without breathing would be if they had no magic.</p>
<p>Note that Opposed aspects reflect strong enough beliefs that they even apply to other Mages. It’s not just that your character can’t work obscuring magic, for example, it’s that no-one can. For these purposes, a character who is Opposed to magic being done is a <a href="Lookouts">Lookout</a>, exactly like someone who has never Awakened at all. This means that a character with a really restrictive view of the world, like that the only magic that exists has to be done through a computer terminal (which they might not even consider magic) may be tricky to be around. Mages by their nature have to be skilled at concealing their craft, however, and nothing is insurmountable. Harmonious magic will slip by just fine, but if you’re going to do Rending magic in front of another Mage, you’ll want to make sure they aren’t Opposed to any aspect of what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Pay attention when choosing Opposed magic to the Paradigms of others at the table. While there is nothing wrong with playing Mages who believe that each other’s magic is impossible, it does make for a very different game than if they all more-or-less agree. That being said, since all Paradigms are different, no-one will ever fully agree on everything.</p>
<p>A Mage may be able to break past their Opposed, and do magic that is Opposed to their own paradigm, but it will always be Rending if they do.</p>
<h3 id="freedoms">Freedoms</h3>
<p>Freedoms are one of the perks that come with working with other Mages over time. Another Mage may choose, when they take an Advancement, to grant your Mage a Freedom. This is a short phrase or sentence that describes how something which appears to fall under one of your Opposed Aspects is actually just fine. The Freedom only comes into play when you are working with the character who gave it to you. If Piper, who has an Opposed aspect of “Silent magic”, is given the Freedom “There is sound among the spirits” by Marcus, then when Piper and Marcus do magic together, Piper can do magic that appears to be silent in the physical world, as long as it somehow involves “sound” in connection with spirits.</p>
<p>Freedoms can be very useful, especially because Mages tend to become less able to directly help one another as they become more powerful (because Help or Hinder uses the number of Anchors to modify the roll). Freedoms let them stop hiding some of their magic from each other, and reward collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h3>
<p>Restrictions are new holes discovered in a Mage’s view of what is possible. They often come about as a result of significant failure: Not only are you unable to do that this time, you’re unable to do it at all. They can cover new discoveries in the fiction about the exact shape of the Paradigm, and they can cover new beliefs gained by the Mage (“I guess I actually can’t breathe underwater.”) Like Freedoms, they are short phrases or sentences, but they add on to Opposed aspects, rather than providing a way to bypass them. A character with the Opposed aspect “magic that prevents movement” might gain the Restriction “Movement for spirits includes multiple dimensions,” and now anything that would trap a spirit on one plane is as unreachable as if it were Opposed. When something says it applies if a Mage is Opposed, this includes if they have a Restriction that applies.</p>
<p>Unlike the Opposed aspects, Restrictions can be overcome. There is an Advancement a Mage can take to remove a Restriction that they have gained, representing an expansion of understanding or self-confidence by the Mage.</p>
<h2 id="harmonious-magic">Harmonious Magic</h2>
<p>Most magic that Mages do is barely distinguishable from coincidence or extreme luck. There’s a reason for this. That kind of magic is easy, and safe. Instead of creating money out of thin air, a Mage prefers to find the exact location buried treasure is hidden, right in their backyard. Maybe it was there before they did their magic, and their magic just allowed them to find it. Or maybe their magic put it there just minutes before it was dug up. Either way, the casual onlooker (and therefore the Consensus) can’t tell the difference. This is called Harmonious magic. This kind of magic acts in harmony with reality, circumvents the rules of the universe, and nobody’s the wiser. There’s a reason you don’t see Mages throwing balls of fire down the streets of Chicago. Nobody’s Paradigm is going to be violated by a Mage happening to have exactly the small item that they need in their pocket.</p>
<h2 id="rending-magic">Rending Magic</h2>
<p>But what if your character thinks they Really Need to throw a fireball down the streets of Chicago? Well first, they’re almost certainly wrong, Rending Magic causes many more problems than it fixes in 99 out of 100 cases. But if they’re dead set on doing it, they’re performing Rending Magic. To do that requires tearing a rather large hole in reality, and that’s when reality fights back. If an effect for any reason can’t be passed of as coincidence or happenstance to the casual onlooker, the effect is very likely Rending. Notably, when you do rending magic, it just works, and you roll the move if it affects a lookout. This can be very powerful, but the costs are very high.</p>
<h3 id="lookouts">Lookouts</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can tear holes in reality and get away with it because no one is around to act as eyes and ears for the Consensus. Rending Magic only triggers the Rending Magic move when it affects a lookout. A lookout is any non-mage human, and any Mage who’s paradigm is Opposed to that rending effect. However, “affects” should be taken as broadly as possible here. If a lookout sees the magic being done, if they are targeted by it, or if a ripple effect causes them to sneeze from the wind generated by your summoned Wind Golem, those are all being affected. If you summon a bar of gold in the privacy of your own warded lab, that’s fine, until the moment you hand that bar of gold to a non-mage as payment, at which point you roll the Rending magic move. You can animate a golem in your basement, and as long as no one sees it or hears a distinctive sound that no human could make, you’re all set. But when the housekeeper opens the locked basement door and sees an animated humanoid form made out of clay, no matter where your mage is, they roll the rending magic move.</p>
<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>
<p>Discord is a buildup of some sort, reality leaving its mark on mages who dare to tear holes in it left and right. The more the discord builds up, the more the Consensus is going to kick you in the butt when it finally comes time to pay the piper. Track your discord on your playbook, and it’s best not to let it build up too much.</p>
<p><a id="backlash_chapter"></a></p>
<h2 id="backlash">Backlash</h2>
<p>This is the universe’s way of fixing itself after a hole is torn in it by Rending magic. It is also the punishment for Mages who break the rules too egregiously. Sometimes a backlash is minor, the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Sometimes you’re banished from reality itself. Depends on how much you’ve been messing with reality, and how much it feels like messing back.</p>
<p>When you trigger the Backlash move, this is one of the few times that rolling lower is better, and you roll adding your current discord. Roll high enough and you cause a localized break in reality. More often though, what will manifest is either some physical sign of your Discord, making your life difficult, or a being of some sort, sent by the Consensus to Enforce its will on you.</p>
<p>Physical signs of discord should affect the character negatively for the rest of the session. Things like milk spoiling around you, electronics refusing to work in your presence, or extreme sensitivity to light and aversion to the sun.</p>
<p>Enforcers for the Consensus can take many different shapes, they will likely take on a form that makes sense within the Mage’s paradigm. They may or may not be able to be seen by other mages, depending on the circumstances. One thing is constant between all physical signs of discord and Enforcers though. Using magic to try and get rid of them or mitigate their consequences will only make matters worse.</p>
<h2 id="reality-breaks">Reality Breaks</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when the Consensus is particularly pushed against, a Mage needs to learn a lesson, reality breaks around them. This can take a number of different forms, pervasive hallucinations that only the mage can see, an entire fantasy world overlaying the real world, making the mage think they’ve been transported elsewhere while in reality they wreak havoc on their world, or a pocket dimension, actually transporting them elsewhere for a time out from reality.</p>
<p>You may have read the section on Rending Magic and wondered how the world survives with that much power in someone’s hand. Why hasn’t a Mage blotted out the sun, or cracked the tectonic plates of the Earth? Well, when they try, Reality tends to Break around them. They may very well go on living in a pocket dimension where they did blot out the sun. Or a fantasy world with a tectonic rift across the city may overlay the actual world for them.</p>
<p>These take a few different forms, but regardless of form, they are the Consensus’ way of protecting itself. This is why, even though Rending Magic can theoretically do anything, you don’t hear about mages blotting out the sun (for more than a short eclipse). If a mage is lucky enough to get out of one, they are usually humbled and have learned to be more in tune with the Consensus, or at least have learned to be more careful with the magic they do.</p>
<p>From the outside, Reality Breaks are the kind of things that most people don’t see, or won’t see. Pervasive hallucinations are things that only the affected Mage can see, and many people are practiced at ignoring someone they think is seeing things. An overlayed fantasy world is similar, in that it only exists for the affected Mage (and perhaps other Mages that know how to look for it). Pocket dimensions, from the outside, may just look like the person disappearing, and any onlookers having their memory of the past few seconds wiped. For a practiced eye, a Mage may be able to find the pinprick hole in reality that caused the Break, and follow it through to attempt a rescue.</p>
<p>When you fall into a Reality break, you choose a trait of your paradigm (either the name, the Aligned, or the Opposed) to be explored by the break, and the MC describes it as they would other new scenes. You also work with the MC to write a move that, when triggered, brings your mage back closer to reality.</p>

<h2 id="rituals">Rituals</h2>

<h3 id="place-of-power">Place of Power</h3>



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<h1 id="the-master-of-ceremonies">The Master of Ceremonies</h1>


<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>
<p>The Agenda is your most abstract, highest order, set of rules. These are your objectives during the game. If you succeed at all of these agendas during a given session, you will find that the story naturally follows.</p>
<p><strong>Provide the characters with strife both within and without.</strong></p>
<p>Mages do not lead boring lives. When they talk with friends and allies, they have deep, weighty conversations that reshape views of reality, or prepare to reshape actual reality. Give them scenes where their beliefs are challenged or they have an opportunity to teach. When they venture out to thwart the plans of insidious forces, the balance can swing on their wits and on the weight of their convictions. Give them scenes where the danger is real and immediate. When they seek a moment’s respite, they forge connections that can guide them like starlight, if they haven’t already turned away. Give them scenes where they can show that they care.</p>
<p><strong>Play to find out what happens.</strong></p>
<p>This means that you don’t have a story planned out that you’re running the players through. It means that even though you might have some inklings of what’s going to happen next, quite often you’ll find out you’re wrong, because the players come up with an idea that just fits, or a move forces your hand. It may seem odd at first if you’re used to a more preparation-heavy style of running a game, but trust us, the fun you have finding out what happens next right along with the players is worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Ask what it means to be human.</strong></p>
<p>Consensus is a game about people who are everything humans can be, want to be, strive to be. But it’s also about how these people still can fail, whether by not being true enough to themselves or by going too far. As you ask leading questions, make moves, and write Forces, focus on making yourself and the other players think about the nature of humanity, theirselves’ and others’. In this game, a scene about a character drowning their sorrows in a bar can be just as important, if not moreso, as a knock-down drag-out fight. Sorrows make us human, while any beast can do battle.</p>
<p><strong>Make the Consensus come to life.</strong></p>
<p>Your job is to play the world and the other people in it as if they were real. No person exists just to give the characters some information and then be ignored, think about what would happen if the characters met someone and demanded something from them, and then needed their help later. In this way, you make the world feel real, like a living, breathing world, one that is exciting to explore.</p>
<h2 id="always-say">Always Say</h2>
<p>When the other players look to you to see what happens, you have to say something. Make sure the things you say follow these rules.</p>
<p><strong>What the principles demand</strong></p>
<p>Your principles, below, address how you speak to the table, and what you say. Don’t contradict any of your principles when you address the table.</p>
<p><strong>What the rules demand</strong></p>
<p>This is both your rules detailed here, and the rest of the rules of play, such as the basic moves, and the playbook moves. Sometimes these will tell you what to say depending on the outcome of a roll.</p>
<p><strong>What your prep demands</strong></p>
<p>When we said above that you can’t make any kind of preparation, we were stretching the truth a little. The game will tell you to make Forces after the first session, and you should always look to these when you don’t know what to say, they will tell you what to say.</p>
<p><strong>What honesty demands</strong></p>
<p>Your job isn’t to lie to the players, or trick them, or make them guess what you’re thinking. Some games are about that, this one isn’t. So when a player asks a question, answer it honestly, and be generous with the truth. If the player’s character enters a room, you should describe it, set the scene, and don’t leave out important details waiting for them to ask the right question.</p>
<h2 id="the-principles">The Principles</h2>
<p><strong>Riddle the world with hidden magic, unexpected connections, and unrecognized potential</strong></p>
<p>Save up those images that speak to you from your favorite media about magic. Don’t just describe a bookstore, talk about the dust laying thick on a stack of books in the back, talk about a ghostly light shining through the motes of dust like a sunbeam normally would. Make the world feel like there’s magic in it, but also that it’s hidden, buried, or unseen.</p>
<p><strong>Create Ephemera</strong></p>
<p>During the game things will come up that need a visual, tactile, or written aid. Draw maps of the cities, write the Mages letters from their mentors on aging parchment, write down the steps of a ritual to be included in a grimoire many years down the road. Play music or ambient sound if it fits the mood. Sketch characters, make props, bring the magic to our world just a little bit. [Add something about the image of the MC handing materials to a Mage’s player and saying “draw this”, as an offer]</p>
<p><strong>Use Character Names</strong></p>
<p>When you’re speaking to the players, make sure to speak at the character they’re playing, use their Mage’s name when you ask them leading questions, or when you ask them what they do next. Speak in first person as the characters you play, engage the Mages in conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Stay in the Narrative</strong></p>
<p>You have a lot of Agendas, Principles, and Moves, and they’re great. They’re wonderful. They’re your rules. But just like a baseball game would be boring if the pitcher stood still and yelled “fastball,” while the batter also stood still and yelled “single,” instead of actually playing the game, you also shouldn’t just say what move you’re making when the players look to you, you should weave that move into the narrative, tell them what it looks like, what their characters can sense about it, tell them what actually happens in the fictional world.</p>
<p><strong>Make Everyone Vulnerable</strong></p>
<p>This principle has a few layers of meaning. First, remember that none of the characters that you make up to interact with the mages, no matter how much you like them, is invincible. Characters can get hurt, captured, or worse, and you shouldn’t be afraid to let that happen to even your favorite character, if that’s what happens in the fiction. Second, remember that everyone has weaknesses, and irrational like or dislike of certain things. Even if they put on a tough face, let your characters be vulnerable. Third, following that, let your characters show emotion, let them connect with the Mages and share those moments of vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Give Everyone Names and Desires</strong></p>
<p>All of your characters should have names, lives, and motivations. There’s no faceless bartender, no shopkeep who only exists to buy and sell from. Everyone in your world should feel real, and three dimensional. When you make characters for the Mages to interact with, give them a goal, whatever they’re striving towards. This may be the same as their Forces goal (see the Forces chapter) but most likely it’s smaller and more personal. Whenever you don’t know how that character would act or react, refer back to their goal.</p>
<p><strong>Demand Evocative Answers, then Follow Through</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you’re going to be asking leading, provocative, and personal questions about the Mages. You can even do so with questions that assert a truth in the question itself, like asking a Mage who they screwed over in the past. This is part of how you build the world collaboratively with the other players. Don’t let them off the hook with simple, safe answers, press for more, get them into the details. And once you’ve got that, make sure to (as they say in improv) “yes, and” their answer and build on it in fun and interesting ways.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, Give Them Exactly What They’re Asking For</strong></p>
<p>Often times, because Mages lives aren’t boring, there’s challenges and hurdles in the way of getting what they want. But if every little step of the way has a hurdle, suddenly no one can move. Sometimes you should give characters exactly what they’re asking for, because otherwise their lives become predictable (and therefore boring). Other times, you should also give them <em>exactly</em> what they ask for, and have them realize why it’s a monkey’s paw just a little too late.</p>
<p><strong>Root for the Mages</strong></p>
<p>You and the other players are on the same team, so it only makes sense to root for the Mages. That doesn’t mean you want their lives to be easy (boring), but you also want to see them overcome their struggles, talk about things that matter to them, and do cool things. Conversely, it’s okay for the Mages to fail, and if it happens you should let it happen and not try to save them, because you’re rooting for them, not trying to play for them. Cheer them on when they do something great, and wince and cover your eyes when they make mistakes, just like you might for your favorite characters on a tv show.</p>
<p><strong>Think About the Bigger Picture</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes something will happen in a scene that has a far-reaching effect, outside of just the limited scene that’s currently on screen. Think about how big things can affect your Forces, even the ones who aren’t present at the moment. Also, sometimes a Mage will roll a 6-, or the table will look to you to see what happens, and none of your moves make sense to have happen right then in that scene. Make a move off-screen, describe what’s happening to the players, and what, if anything, their characters notice about it.</p>
<p><strong>Take Some Decisions Out Of Your Own Hands</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you just don’t have an answer, or you don’t want to be responsible for the outcome of something. You’re allowed to pass the buck occasionally, by doing one of a few things. You can turn the question back on one of the players. “I don’t know Vince, do you have a secret stash of highly dangerous alchemical components in your apartment?” You can look to the outcome of a move, if one applies. You can look to the relevant character’s goal, or you can look to the relevant Force’s status track. Those might already have the decision made for you.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Be Afraid to be Obvious</strong></p>
<p>It can be so easy to get wrapped up in trying to think of something cool and unique, and sometimes that’s fun, but this game works very well if you sometimes just do or say the obvious thing. Tropes are tropes for a reason, and actions have logical consequences, so when a Mage is trying to <strong>Outwit, Outpace, or Outfox</strong> a pursuer by climbing up a tall building, and they roll a 6-, you can go ahead and have the obvious thing happen. They fall flat on their back and hurt themselves (Deal Damage).</p>
<p>Being obvious can let the players feel good that they predicted something. It’s boring if that happens too often, but getting it right from time to time can be rewarding and satisfying. Plus, if everyone knows what is obviously coming up and seems into it, then you already know that if you make it happen, the players will like it.</p>
<p>Additionally, since everyone is different, sometimes what is obvious to you isn’t at all obvious to the other players. In our experience, you can just keep saying what’s obvious, and the players will keep thinking the story is full of creative twists and turns.</p>
<h2 id="your-moves">Your Moves</h2>
<p>Your moves behave differently from other moves in the game. While most moves trigger when a character not controlled by you takes an action in the fiction, your moves are a set of options to choose from when the others at the table look to you. The move gives you the general framework of what happens, and then it’s up to you to describe the actual events in the narrative. Everyone at the table looking at you will usually happen when nothing else is happening, when one of their moves prompts a response or interpretation from you, or when they are asking a question about the world. You will privately pick a move, come up with how it works in, and then make it real.</p>
<p>Your moves are short phrases like “Make them Conjure or Buy” or “Imprison someone.” Other than in-game concepts like Discord, they don’t carry special meaning. “Raise the Stakes” really does literally mean do that. Moves must always follow from the fiction, and likely will not look the same twice. In one scene, you might choose to Raise the Stakes by having a tense conversation about which bedroom a guest will stay in suddenly become about whether to remain roommates at all. In another, Raising the Stakes might be knives coming out at a fistfight. Whatever happens, describe it in the context of the fiction, not the game rules. It shouldn’t actually matter to the other players that you are using Invent a Predicament for Someone. What matters is that a Lookout saunters into the alley for a smoke break just as they’re about to step through their dimensional door.</p>
<p>When you make a move, it can be broadly categorized as “hard” or “soft”. Hard moves have consequences that are immediate and irrevocable. They should inspire further action, but will not simply be undone or blocked. A secret coming out, an item breaking, an injury. Soft moves advance the action, in particular by setting up hard moves that will come to pass if the Mages don’t intercede. Someone coming home but not yet seeing a Mage in a compromising position could be a soft move, and if the Mage doesn’t work to hide or explain things, then soon the secret will come out, as a hard move. Most moves can be hard or soft, depending on the circumstances, but some are easier to use one way or the other. We have arranged them from generally softer to generally harder, but that’s just for convenience, and for when you’re looking for inspiration.</p>
<p>When you need to choose a move, choose one that can follow logically from the game’s fiction. It might not be the only one, but it should be plausible. Remember it’s OK to be obvious, so if something from a moment ago could demand a response, then find a move that fits it and say that. However, also remember your Principle to Think about the Bigger Picture. Things you have set up in the past can suddenly make an appearance and still be following from the fiction.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you’ll be making soft moves. These let the action keep advancing, but keep giving the other players the ability to respond to things. Remember that soft moves should suggest hard moves that could occur if nothing happens. It can even be as direct as “With a crack, the branch breaks. You’re right underneath it! What will you do?” and if they say “I keep standing there”, then go ahead and use a hard move to deal damage.</p>
<p>You are empowered to make a hard move when they hand you a perfect opportunity on a silver platter. This can be because the character explicitly ignores a soft move that was already in play. It can also be because a character tries something that will clearly go poorly for them, and you respond with the soft move that is Tell them the possible consequences and ask, and they follow through with it anyway. If something that you have been setting up, through one or more soft moves, comes to pass, that’s a time to make a hard move. This won’t be a surprise because of the principle to be generous with the truth, but can represent the Mages running out of time, or the dramatic irony of the Mages not noticing something that the players are aware of. In addition, if someone rolls a 6-, you make a hard move. It may be mostly dictated by a “on a 6-” clause in the player’s move if present, but most of the time you’re on your own, and have to follow the fiction to come up with an outcome.</p>
<p>One very flexible soft move is Set up a Future Problem, which can stretch to anything from the extreme short term, like “The car swerves and is coming right at you!” to a more far-off “As you shake the Dean’s hand, you see a camera flash. This will definitely be in the papers tomorrow…”</p>
<p>Another flexible move is Declare Something Bad has Happened Elsewhere. “Something bad” is quite broad, and the thing about Mages is that today’s “elsewhere” is often tomorrow’s “here.”</p>
<p>After you make a move, always turn it back to the other players. Ask them, “what do you do?”</p>
<h3 id="softer-moves">Softer Moves</h3>
<p><strong>Tell them the possible consequences and ask</strong></p>
<p>This is a handy move to use for when a Mage gets stuck with a hard choice. It’s also good for times when they ask if it’s possible for their character to do something. Also for times when they say something like “I jump out of the airplane.” Tell them the possible consequences of getting what they want, and ask “do you do it?” For example:</p>
<p><em>“So Piper, you’re trying to prove that you’re someone these spirits should listen to. You can do it, but you’re going to have to bring your people in line and snap at one of them. They’re going to feel hurt. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost</strong></p>
<p>Another very handy move, especially when the table stalls a little bit. You can use this for anything from telling the Mages about a great sale on herbs, to letting them eavesdrop on someone important. For example:</p>
<p><em>“Yes, you can get closer and hear exactly what they’re saying, but if you want to stay hidden you’re going to have to step directly on a pile of rare books. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Set Up a Future Problem</strong></p>
<p>One of your most versatile moves, this is one of your best ways to set up a future hard move. In particular this should give the Mages information which, if they don’t act on, will result in a hard move. This could be far in the future, for example:</p>
<p><em>“You get the ritual off in time, and as the final energy flashes out from your circle, you realize that some of it got siphoned off into a battery on the other side of town. Someone must be trying to power some really big magic. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p>This can also be very near in the future, even just a moment in the future. For example:</p>
<p><em>“They activate a runic circle drawn on the ground in front of them, and you see an electrical wire break off the telephone pole, it’s headed straight for Piper. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Give Them an Answer They Won’t Like</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes Mages are trying to gather information, or ask a question about the world. This move is where you can let them succeed on gathering that information, or let them notice the thing about the world they’re asking about, but when they do they find out it’s not what they were hoping for. For example:</p>
<p><em>“Your research on the ancient faeries is actually quite fruitful, you learn that they were much more powerful, well respected, and given a wide berth if possible. They don’t share the modern faeries weakness to iron, music, or fire. And worst of all, you learn that they feed off mortal magic. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Pit their Desires Against Each Other</strong></p>
<p>This can mean either pitting one Mage’s desire against another’s, or it can mean making a single Mage’s desires conflict in that moment. For example:</p>
<p><em>“The ice princess is willing to give you what you need to rescue your friend, a scepter made of pure unmelting ice, but if she does so, she warns that she won’t be able to hold off the ghosts that have been threatening you any more. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Demand Upkeep from an Anchor</strong></p>
<p>Anchors are real people, or places, or things that need attention paid to them. That’s how they ground the Mage. So a window being broken in your apartment, or a call from your mother asking you to stop by for a family party since she hasn’t seen you in forever. These are particularly useful to set up later scenes focusing on that Anchor, because the Mage either needs to go upkeep that relationship, or risk losing their tether to reality.</p>
<p><em>“You finish reading that tome and the possibilities are running through your head, there’s so much you can do now that you never could before. But before you get a chance to test any of it, your phone rings. It’s your aunt calling to remind you that you promised to mow the lawn yesterday, and it’s going to rain tomorrow, so you really need to get over there and do it. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Slip a Status</strong></p>
<p>Status tracks are divided into two sections, which amount to basically “Stable” or “Slipping.” If a status track has hit code 30 or below, it’s slipping, and will keep getting worse faster and faster. Mechanically, this happens quickly because it is a soft move. This move describes it getting worse. For example:</p>
<p><em>“Yeah, you run and catch up with them, but that cracked rib from earlier just isn’t putting up well with the exertion, and suddenly you feel a stabbing pain in your right side, and it’s harder to breathe. Slip your health status track down to Code 20, punctured lung. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Make them Conjure or Buy</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a player will ask you if their Mage has a certain item, and you’re not sure. One thing to do is to tell them that they don’t, but they know where they can buy it. Or since they’re Mages, if they can figure out a way to conjure it, they’re welcome to have it.</p>
<p><em>“You don’t have any Black Cohosh for that healing potion on hand, it’s endangered in fact. But you think Ashley at the local herb shop might have some tucked away in the locked display case. You remember it being pretty expensive though. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Show them the Downsides of their Paradigm</strong></p>
<p>This is a way to make the Mages think about their magic. Put them in a situation where their Paradigm, their way of seeing the world, is more hindrance than it is a help, as opposed to normal, where it is likely a source of freedom and agency.</p>
<p><em>“So you’ve been preparing for this meeting for a while now, and to make sure you’re suitably prepared, were going to connect with your Source. So you do a line of coke, and you know how it lets you see the true nature of things? You realize you’re starting to see everyone’s personal demons. There are so many, it’s getting hard to see, or focus. Some of them make it hard to keep it together. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Invent a Predicament for Someone</strong></p>
<p>Players will put their Mages in all sorts of predicaments anyway, but sometimes it’s good to throw an unexpected one at them, and put the Mage (not necessarily the player) on the spot.</p>
<p><em>"Remember how we talked about what would happen if your sister showed up? Just as you complete the spirit binding and the gears begin to turn on their own, you hear a pounding at the door and a familiar voice. ‘River! I know you’re home!’ What do you do?</em></p>
<p><strong>Raise the Stakes</strong></p>
<p>This means raising the tension, putting more on the line, or otherwise upping the amount of investment the Mages have in the outcome of a given situation. For example:</p>
<p><em>“Your ritual goes off wonderfully, and you’re just about to close down the circle when a sinister presence steps through the gate in the fence. They look at you and say in a deep, rumbling voice ‘You’ve stopped us from possessing any of you, true, but now we’re going to possess the entire city, and there aren’t enough of you to stop that.’ What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Introduce a Lookout</strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes, Mages try to set up circumstances so that they can make free use of their magic, without anyone “spying” on them for the Consensus. They’ll meet up with other Mages in secret basements, summon spirits deep in the woods, or they set up a distraction for everyone else in the area. So it can provide some complications when a Lookout shows up out of nowhere. If they’re about to do Rending magic, they’ll either have to stop, or trigger the move. And if they’re about to do “questionably” harmonious magic, a lookout being there will likely make them have to Sell a Lie to keep it from being Rending.</p>
<p><em>“The two of you have just finished lining the doorway in chalk runes, but before you can activate the portal, a patron comes in from the other side. ‘Excuse me, is this the reference section?’ What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Threaten an Anchor</strong></p>
<p>Much like the Demand Upkeep from an Anchor move, this one is a little bit more immediate. Capture their cousin, or slap a foreclosure sign on their house. Remember, they have to go deal with it, or will lose it.</p>
<p><em>“You get home, eager to tune up your motorcycle and maybe go for a spin…and instead find a ticket with the number of a tow truck company! What do you do?”</em></p>
<h3 id="soft-or-hard-moves">Soft or Hard Moves</h3>
<p><strong>Hit them with the static realities of their world</strong></p>
<p>Mages often wish they lived in a full fantasy world, but sadly they do not. The Consensus holds sway, and is strong. Use this move when they come face-to-face with the limitations that even Mages find.</p>
<p><em>“The building is oppressive, and you can feel the weight of disbelief. Try as you might, you can’t find the kind of convenient, shadowed corner you need to hide a transformation. Fluorescent light bathes every inch. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Isolate Them</strong></p>
<p>Mages are most powerful when they are together, even if their personalities may clash. Use this when you want to separate one or two from others they expected to be with.</p>
<p><em>“You suddenly notice that while you were talking, the sun has set, and now you’re not sure where the rest of the cabal is. You hear sirens in the distance. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Use one of your Force Moves</strong></p>
<p>Forces have moves of their own, dictated by the Stressor the Force relates to. You should have the moves written on your Forces sheets, and can use one of them just like any other MC move.</p>
<p><em>Consider a game with a Force of rationality-focused Mages who seek to stamp out mystery, wonder, and creativity. They exhibit the Stressor Control, and have the move “Blackmail them”.</em></p>
<p><em>“When you check your mail, you find an envelope with no return address or postmark. Inside is a picture of your house, and a letter that just says: ‘We know you’re behind the blackouts. Don’t even think about showing your face tomorrow.’ What do you <strong>do</strong>?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Declare Something Bad has Happened Elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>You have a Principle to Think about the Bigger Picture, and this is a direct expression of that. “Elsewhere” should be somewhat relevant, whether somewhere that you know the Mages will be back to, or whatever happened there is now coming here.</p>
<p><em>“With a start you realize… if all of you are here, who’s watching Amanda!? You hear a deep mocking laugh from the other side of the building.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You hear the sound of sirens off in the distance. They could be headed this way, or it could be a coincidence, but do you want to take that risk?”</em></p>
<p><strong>Make their Move Backfire</strong></p>
<p>Many moves have clear ways they can go wrong. Attacks misfire, plans play into an enemy’s hands, intimate moments sour. You can show the worst possible outcome for a move, or can show someone else do it better.</p>
<p><em>“You cast around looking for Any Port in this raging Storm of magical energy, and you realize there’s only one spot. The eye of the storm, which is occupied by the beast itself.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You begin to speak with the full authority of the Winter Court, to tell these upstarts their place, when the Winter Princess herself steps out from behind a tree and says ‘Actually…’”</em></p>
<h3 id="harder-moves">Harder Moves</h3>
<p><strong>Change the Battlefield</strong></p>
<p>Use this when you want to throw the Mages’ control of a situation into question. This can be like Raise the Stakes, but encompasses things that are more out of left field as well. Changing the “battlefield” (even if it’s actually just a parlour filled with relatives) can mean new Forces arrive, an environmental effect, or revealing a dramatic complication.</p>
<p>*“So you Step Sideways, planning to phase out and phase back in, but while you’re on the Other Side you see this vast space with creepy floating creatures, and they’re fighting to get in. It looks like this battle is taking place on more planes than you knew.”</p>
<p><em>“Everyone’s fighting, you feel like you have a good handle on things - and then the ghost pirate ship appears, with Gordon dangling in a cage off the bow. They’re rowdy and their cannons are armed.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Take away things they expect to have</strong></p>
<p>Most of the time, you can assume the Mages have what they need for what they want to do. A cell phone, a bottle of water, batteries. This extends to more rare items, once a Mage has acquired it and makes a point of keeping it around. When you use this move, suddenly all those assumptions go out the window. It can be direct and in the moment, like having a business card snatched away, or it could be retrospective and only now realized, like a wand not being where it was last put down.</p>
<p>*“So you shoot the harpoon gun, but you aren’t braced and the gun flies out of your hands, backwards! Your target falls, but another guy sees that you’re unarmed and jumps at you.”</p>
<p><em>“Something has gone mysteriously missing? How about the gas for your boat. Not that you’d notice right away, of course.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Imprison Someone</strong></p>
<p>Mages’ lives involve the fundamental freedom to do what they believe, and so imprisonment is a particularly stark action. It doesn’t have to be to a Mage in particular, but if it involves anyone they care about, it can dramatically shape their reactions. In a world full of police, gangsters, manipulative relatives, and magical binding circles, “imprisonment” can take many forms.</p>
<p>*“As you look around the ballroom, you notice what are clearly ensorcelled humans serving drinks, and wait, that’s the man you saved from drowning! As dead-eyed as the rest of them.”</p>
<p><em>“Allison opens the door to get into the taxi, and the driver looks you in the eye, and as you recognize him, says ‘My Lady sends her regards,’ and drives off before you can react”</em></p>
<p><strong>Adjust a Status Track</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a mage’s actions (or inactions) should have a clear and obvious impact on a status track, but that status track isn’t yet slipping; or maybe increasing its status isn’t what makes sense. Adjust it as you see fit: advance an Anchor upkeep track, de-escalate a Front track, or even reduce the severity of a mage’s health status.</p>
<p><em>“As you finish your impassioned speech and look out over the crowd, you realize it’s falling flat; they aren’t buying it. And then they start jeering, and you see your credibility slipping away. Set your Consensus Shift status track back to 40.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s been a busy time for you all, hasn’t it? Police called because of the fraternity twice, position as a social hub has been falling because the coolest kids are going everywhere but to you for their parties, and now that Piper’s staying there things are getting tense. You get a letter from the administration, the fraternity is officially on probation.”</em> While you mark off another code on the Home Front Status Track.</p>
<p><em>“Sure, your magic centers around the Breath of Life. As you speak soothing words, he breathes easier. Lazarus, heal 1 Harm.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Add a Restriction to a Mage’s Paradigm</strong></p>
<p>A mage’s paradigm is inherent and intuitive, and sometimes it might take some exploration to understand the full extent of it. Sometimes that exploration re-categorizes certain things from ‘we might be able to finagle a way to do that’ to ‘that’s flat-out impossible and I can’t believe we ever thought otherwise." When a mage attempts an edge-case use of magic and it doesn’t go in their favor, that’s a good time to add a restriction to their paradigm to reflect that update to their magical approach.</p>
<p><em>“So his fist is coming for your head, and as your self-protective instincts take over, you try to yank at his life-thread to throw him off balance. But you can’t get a grip on it, and he keeps coming. It occurs to you as your head rings from the impact that there never has been room in your paradigm for selfish acts. Add a restriction to your paradigm: self-defense is considered selfish.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So you reach out for ghosts under the sea - and get nothing at all. Maybe this is why ghost pirates always have a ship. Add this restriction: The Sea’s Vastness Outdoes Mortal Magic.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You try to speak across boundaries to him, but it’s like his mind is a mirrored sphere. You can’t reach him, and add the restriction, ‘The close-minded hears only themselves.’”</em></p>
<p><strong>Assign Discord</strong></p>
<p>Discord is what happens when reality bends around a Mage like a spring. It hasn’t given yet, but something is probably going to happen. Rending magic that affects a Lookout always produces some, but sometimes other sources of Discord will follow from the fiction.</p>
<p><em>“You’re used to having that little harmonious spell that keeps your garden pest-free going, but just as Jack, your new neighbor, comes over, and their eyes glance over the perfectly-formed leaves, you feel a sudden lurch. Take 1 Discord. ‘I’m looking forwards <strong><em><em>so</em></em></strong> much to getting to know you,’ says Jack, eyes gleaming unpleasantly. What do you do?”</em></p>
<p>*“You’re not working at all within the local expectations. Your camera flashlight can work to illuminate Glamour, but take 2 Discord.”</p>
<p><em>“The ritual is being resisted by something with a deep hold over this place. You all take 1 Discord, and at this rate it’s going to get worse.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Deal Damage</strong></p>
<p>The life of a mage is dangerous, and danger often involves pain. When they fall, when they’re struck, when they deign to tinker with untested equipment while not wearing PPE, deal damage and have them roll to Suffer Harm.</p>
<p><em>“Even as you tug haphazardly at the tangle of wires, you realize the moment when ‘down to the wire’ becomes ‘too late,’ and you aren’t going to defuse the bomb in time. You scramble backwards as it ticks down to zero, and are thrown back with the force of the explosion. Take four harm.”</em></p>
<p>*“So there’s this big boom from out on the water, and huge droplets spill down on you - and hand-sized swordfish. One gets you right in the shoulder. Take 2 Harm.”</p>
<p>“It’s trident against trident, and you stab him good, but he got you, too, with a glancing blow. 1 Harm.”*</p>
<p><strong>Make them Backlash</strong></p>
<p>Magic in a Consensus that denies its existence carries its own inherent risk. That risk most often manifests in the form of backlash. Use this move when a spell goes sideways, a spirit gets away from them, or a Mage reaches too far.</p>
<p>"<em>It’s the first time you’ve tried using magic to change your own appearance, and you’re wrestling with your own mind as it clings to your established self-image. It takes all your willpower to silence that internal dissent, but you’re on the verge of succeeding–until you catch a glimpse of your distorted reflection on the window. The unfinished spell shatters and turns against you. Roll backlash."</em></p>
<p><em>“As you and George lock eyes, you feel all that Discord bouncing around inside you trying to get out, and suddenly - it does.”</em></p>
<h2 id="running-a-session">Running a Session</h2>
<p>A session of Consensus is a self-contained advance of the story. It will build on what came before and set up new directions for the future, but it has a beginning, middle, and end, and should always change the game world in ways not easily undone.</p>
<h3 id="starting-a-session">Starting a Session</h3>
<p>Your MC sheet has a list of steps to guide you through the beginning of the session.</p>
<h4 id="gather-the-mc-sheet-pc-summary-sheet-fronts-flags-and-portents">Gather The MC sheet, PC summary sheet, Fronts, Flags, and Portents</h4>
<p>These cover all the essential information you need to make sure the table has available.</p>
<h4 id="look-over-and-read-out-flags-note-which-ones-can-be-changed">Look over and read out Flags, note which ones can be changed</h4>
<p>Flags are one of the main methods that allow Mages to mark experience, so everyone should be reminded of them and be able to reference them. In addition, Flags which have been hit at least once are available to be changed if the player wishes, so remind them of that.</p>
<h4 id="mark-one-code-off-every-portent-status-track">Mark one Code off every Portent Status Track</h4>
<p>Portents have a fairly short lifespan, so that they will be brought up again before they fade out of memory. If you mark off Code N of the Portent, it should come up fairly early in the session.</p>
<h4 id="mark-one-code-off-every-anchor-status-track">Mark one Code off every Anchor Status Track</h4>
<p>Anchors require maintenance. The Status Tracks advancing represent this.</p>
<h4 id="note-all-slipping-status-tracks">Note all slipping Status Tracks</h4>
<p>Status Tracks which are slipping are very relevant during this session. They should feel like whatever they are connected to is beginning to spiral out of control, or fall out of reach, or come to an inexorable conclusion. Advancing a slipping Status Track is a soft move, so you can do it almost any time it makes sense, and going over them at the start of the session will help you think of it. Write the slipping Status Tracks on your MC sheet.</p>
<h4 id="review-any-effects-that-last-session-were-decided-to-be-extended-into-this-one">Review any effects that last session were decided to be extended into this one</h4>
<p>Some game effects last “for the rest of the session”, but might come up near the end of one. This lets you extend things that seem worth it, like a bonus or penalty that hasn’t come into play yet.</p>
<h4 id="perform-moves-triggered-at-start-of-session">Perform moves triggered at start of session</h4>
<p>Remind the players to perform moves on their sheets which are triggered at the start of the session. These won’t start the action exactly, even on a 6-, but they do prepare things.</p>
<h4 id="frame-a-scene-and-make-a-soft-move">Frame a scene and make a soft move</h4>
<p>Now, you have seen all of the pieces you have to work with. Fairly abstractly, there are the Mages with their hopes and desires, and the Forces relevant to their world. More urgently, there are Portents, Anchors, and other Status Tracks that are demanding attention, and you may have already been told to make moves. Now, frame a scene according to the rules below, and open the action with a soft move, to require a response, and you’re off.</p>
<h3 id="scene-framing-and-spotlight">Scene Framing and Spotlight</h3>
<p>Consensus is played out in scenes. Each one should go as long as it needs to but no longer. This usually means about 15-30 minutes, but you will find what rhythms work for your table.</p>
<p>A scene involves one or more of the Mages. One of your jobs is to manage the “spotlight”, making sure that everyone gets some time with scenes focused on them and doesn’t go too long away from the action. Some sessions may have most or all of the Mages together in the same scenes, but often the Mages will want to go their own separate ways. Look out for opportunities to show them together in twos or threes, but don’t neglect individual scenes when they fit. When you are deciding on a new scene, think about who hasn’t been central recently, and see if you can frame one around them.</p>
<p>All scenes should fall into at least one of three categories: “Anchor scenes”, “Inspiration scenes”, and “Force scenes”. The categories serve different purposes, for the Mages’ goals and the advancement of the story. If you know which Mages are going to be in a new scene, their last known positions or their goals may dictate or inspire what category the scene should be. Or, you may know what category of scene comes next, and then figure out what would be going on and so what Mages would be involved. If you only know what’s going on, not who is involved or which category it should be, think about the category first, and then set the scene with mages who inspire that kind of scene. We find the game feels best when you keep a balance between the types of scenes, roughly 1/3 of each in a given session. Of course some sessions will involve a lot more paradigm discussion than anything else, and that’s okay, but when you’re guiding the scenes, keep the 1/3 rule in the back of your mind.</p>
<h4 id="anchor-scenes">Anchor Scenes</h4>
<p>One of the central tensions of a Mage’s life is feeling like they have one foot in each of two worlds. Sometimes they’re probably late to work because a spell took longer than expected. Sometimes they miss the midnight full moon ritual time because their parent is sick in the hospital. Sometimes their Aunt June wants them to go to a craft fair on Sunday because they haven’t had quality time in forever, but there’s a spirit killing people on the loose, and Sunday is the only time the rest of your Cabal can get together to stop it.</p>
<p>Anchor scenes are about what keeps our Mages human, and tethered to the human world. An example might be a scene spending time with their Connection Anchor (Aunt June) doing something that they both enjoy (going to a craft fair). Another might be a scene of scrounging and doing odd jobs in order to afford rent on their Shelter Anchor. These can take many forms, but in general they are the most grounded scenes in Consensus. During an Anchor scene is also when a Mage can refresh their preparations, so long as the Anchor that the scene is based on isn’t slipping. Often an anchor scene will be about upkeeping the anchor or relationship with the anchor, and thus will clear that anchor’s status track.</p>
<p>If the Anchor <strong>is</strong> slipping, then there will be something key going on that, if not addressed, will cause the Mage to lose the Anchor. This might have been understood before the scene, if events have made it clear, or it might need to be determined as the scene begins. Whatever it is, this makes the scene more urgent, even if the Mage is trying to stay cool. In this case, focus on the real importance of the Mage’s choices, and how they still can keep the Anchor, if they’re willing to work at it. If the Mage is successful at reconnecting with their Anchor, clear the Status Track. They have a reprieve, for now. If they aren’t… refer to slipping status tracks and the move <strong>Lose an Anchor</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="inspiration-scenes">Inspiration Scenes</h4>
<p>Many Mages have big, sweeping ideas about the world, the Universe, and their place in it. Mages who don’t still tend to find themselves brushing up against questions about these things, whether they like it or not. Inspiration scenes focus in on this aspect of their lives, seeing what happens when Mages get talking.</p>
<p>They are called Inspiration scenes because a Mages’ Inspirations, or potential Inspirations, are very common sources of these events. Two Mages having a long discussion about not only their Paradigms but what the differences mean to how they accomplish things in the world and how they feel about the people around them will probably become Inspirations for each other. This also covers more esoteric scenes like a Mage deciding to really get to know the spirit that lives in their wand.</p>
<p>Inspiration scenes can be tricky because they’re a less-common type of scene to see in a roleplaying game. However, players often really do enjoy them. Look out for when it seems like a Mage could have a good time teaching, learning, or just talking, and give them Inspiration scenes to play it out.</p>
<h4 id="force-scenes">Force Scenes</h4>
<p>A Force scene is a goal-seeking scene. Either a force is working towards their goals, and the Mages either help or hinder, or the Mages have a goal, which various Forces will help or hinder.</p>
<p>As the scene starts, if the Mages involved already have a clear goal, your moves present interesting choices and challenges. If they do not and are being more reactive to a Force, then start with a soft move that gives the Mages something to react to, and therefore a goal.</p>
<p>Continue until it’s clear what the outcome is going to be. If there’s a conflict and it becomes clear the Mages have the upper hand, go ahead and wrap up and move to the next scene. If no clarity is coming, that tells you that instead of a resolution, further scenes will be needed to see more sides of these events. Wrap it up so that it doesn’t drag on, and start later scenes reacting to the ongoing status.</p>
<h3 id="ending-a-session">Ending a Session</h3>
<p>At some point, it will be the right time to end the session. Maybe the players will have time constraints, or a significant climax was reached in the story and everyone will need some time to process, or maybe everyone is just getting antsy. This is often around 3 hours, but really does vary hugely by table. When it is time, after the scene wraps up, announce it is the end of the session, and read out the move:</p>
<p>At the end of session: note any effects that lasted “until end of session,” but should continue into the next. Then, ask yourselves these questions as a group. For every one you answer “yes” to, everyone marks experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Did you show the lengths you were willing to go to in order to maintain an Anchor?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you uncover a secret?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you learn something that puts your paradigms in perspective, or caused you to question them?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you expose the depths of your humanity, to yourself or to someone else?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you witness loss, selfishness, or pain born of magic?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Effects that last “until end of session” but might continue into the next include things like the physical representation of Discord in the Backlash move. If it happened in the last scene, for example, its full weight probably won’t have been felt, so it would definitely be worth extending into the next session. However, don’t feel obligated, if something already seems played out, or is otherwise no longer interesting.</p>
<h2 id="your-sheets">Your Sheets</h2>
<p>These sheets help you organize your thoughts and are more tools for keeping the game running.</p>
<h3 id="the-mc">The MC</h3>
<p>This sheet should be front-and-center. It reminds you of your agenda and principles, and lists all of your moves, arranged from hard moves to soft moves to help prompt you when it’s time to make one. It also has a place to list all the currently-slipping Status Tracks, so that they are never far from your mind (and never far from the Slip a Status Track move).</p>
<h3 id="pc-summaries">PC Summaries</h3>
<p>This sheet collapses the essential details of the Mages down to the size of cards. Especially early in the campaign, it can help you refer to the Mages by their names, and means you don’t constantly have to ask “What are your Opposed Aspects again? And what’s your mother’s name?”. You don’t need to obsessively track every single detail of the characters here, but keep the broad strokes.</p>
<h3 id="forces">Forces</h3>
<p>Forces are your main organizational tool for notable elements in the world, and the sheets collect all the relevant information about them. Keeping them close at hand will help you make Force moves, or realize what Force to bring in when you think about the bigger picture. Do keep them updated, as their Status Tracks change, as cast members come and go, and as you associate custom moves and other details with them.</p>
<p>It’s OK to write some speculation on Force sheets, but remember not to actually plan anything. As such, it should be fine for a player to see one, since you shouldn’t have any deep dark secrets you are scheming to unveil at the worst possible moment.</p>
<h2 id="sundries">Sundries</h2>
<p>Some things to remember.</p>
<p>When you’re trying to figure out what to say, and picking a Move, remember that the game’s rules will influence what you’re going to say. For example, when a mage rolls the Suffer Harm move, on a 7-9, the MC chooses an option. So you choose one of those options, and since the Principles say to Stay in the Narrative, you describe what happens to the Mage based on which option you choose.</p>
<p>Your Forces will also inform what you say. Not only from their Force moves, but for example, when a ritual draws unwanted attention, you should look at your forces to see which ones might count as “unwanted attention” for that particular ritual.</p>
<p>Like we mentioned above, sometimes you’ll want to turn questions back on the person who asked them, or turn them over to the group at large. <em>“That’s a good question, who are the Frat House’s biggest rivals?”</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to let your narration wander a little bit. Imagine looking idly at the scene, like you’ve paused a movie, and notice some detail, something not at all relevant or material to the scene, and describe it. For example, <em>“here’s no heater in this basement, but there is an intricate symbol etched into the wall. It looks faded now, but you can just catch a sense of heat, and looking deeper into it the lines curve in on themselves like licking tongues of flame…”</em></p>
<p>Zoom in and out of scenes sometimes. Sometimes you’ll want to plan out a ritual in exacting detail, and describe everyone’s every motion as they contribute to it, but then partway through the ritual, say “And the rest of it goes off without a hitch.” Same goes for between sessions. Sometimes you’ll want to pick up moments after the last session finished, other times you can make it days or weeks later. Use your judgement, and do what’s fun for you and the rest of the table.</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll want to zoom in on a move too, Outmaneuvering someone might mean parkour over a wall and crossing 10 feet of distance. It might also mean staying ahead of their search teams for the next week. You can use moves to find out what happens in very zoomed in scenes, and very zoomed out ones as well.</p>
<p>Take breaks when you feel like it. The game taking place in scenes gives you a lot of stopping points, and though sometimes you’ll want to continue straight on to the next one, sometimes it will feel better to take a little while to stretch, refill drinks, and so on. Pay attention to when the energy at the table is flagging and it might be worth everyone clearing their heads. You’ll be surprised with a little physical motion can do for your energy. Conversely, a short break at a cliffhanger can help make things more intense. I usually find that about three breaks during a three to four hour session feels right, two short and one long.</p>

<p><a id="gear_and_accoutrements_chapter"></a></p>
<h1 id="gear-and-accoutrements-1">Gear and Accoutrements</h1>
<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
<p>\begin{Player}</p>
<p>Gear covers notable possessions. This is the modern world, so there are lots of trivial or common items that don’t get mentioned often: You probably have a pair of shoes, could carry a pen, may have a flashlight and so on. You may be likely to have a cellphone, depending on where and when your story is set, and the characters’ socioeconomic status. These aren’t called out anywhere on your character sheet. That doesn’t mean they don’t exist, of course. You might use them as part of a move, and some MC moves might mean that it turns out your wallet fell out of your pocket and you only notice at the worst possible moment. Determine together, as a table, what is normal to expect people to have (a game about working in an Antarctic base is going to have different assumptions from one about being deep in the city). You also might want to have it be noteworthy that your character lacks one or more expected modern-day items. But, in general, don’t stress about exactly how many socks your character has.</p>
<p>However, some things are interesting by their nature, and most everyone has items that are relevant to them, and show something about their preparation, or sentimentality. This is listed under Gear on your character sheet, and you select it from lists during character creation.</p>
<p>Starting gear is listed in categories, from within which you choose. Think about why your character happens to have that, what it means, and how they might have used it already. Mention it to the other players, too, since it might spark ideas for them.</p>
<p>Note that starting gear also doesn’t cover some other possessions, like where you live, or items that are Anchors. Homes are particularly important (see the <a href="AnchorsChapter">Anchors chapter</a>), and having one to live in usually means it is an Anchor, unless something unusual has happened. For other Anchors, though, if they represent something that would generally need to be called out in Gear, like a gun or a motorcycle, then they need to also be listed under Gear or else they are sentimental, but not functional. Starting Anchors and starting Gear should usually have an option that allows them to line up in this way. Nothing stops you from choosing one but not the other, of course. Maybe the motorcycle is just a motorcycle, nothing special, and maybe the pistol that keeps you Anchored to the memory of your father had its barrel welded shut when you were a child, as a form of protest.</p>
<p>When you make or acquire a new item of significance, either through normal play or through a move such as Universal Programmer, make sure to write it on your playbook under the Gear section. Sometimes this could be as simple as telling the MC you’d like to buy something.</p>
<h3 id="savings">Savings</h3>
<p>Money is hard to deal with. In some games, it makes sense to simply keep track of gold coins as they come and go. The modern world is more complicated. In small groups, systems of favors and mutual interdependence often overshadow money. In addition, the existence of secondhand shops, eBay, and bargain hunting mean that you can often find something within your price range, as long as you aren’t too picky.</p>
<p>To represent this, money in Consensus is handled abstractly. Prices are given as a number of Savings that have to be spent. Importantly, this number of Savings is supposed to be roughly the same for different characters, but the details and quality of the good or service will depend on the character’s in-fiction wealth. For example, “a nice meal for two” is listed as one Saving. The difference is, if those two work minimum wage jobs, it might be a meal at their favorite chain that includes dessert. If they are a movie star and an internationally-featured artist, it’s probably a custom creation by a personal chef.</p>
<p>Your character has a certain number of Savings, beginning with the amount listed under their Starting Gear. Subtract from this when told to, usually spending or Anchor upkeep. The MC may also you to increase your Mage’s Savings, such as when getting paid for a job, or selling something valuable. A steady job can be difficult for a Mage to keep up, however, it does somewhat guarantee a supply of Savings, which can be worth it.</p>
<p>Of course, your Mage can shapes Reality to their whims and can decide that money is a problem for other people, and seek to circumvent it with magic. If you aren’t changing a bartender’s mind to add it to their tab just this one more time, you might have the $20 you need blow in on a dust devil, or win a small lottery, or go digging for buried treasure in your backyard and, incredibly, find a chest of pirate gold. This does have all the usual rending dangers of repeated coincidence, of course. It is much more harmonious to change things up, than to keep diggings holes in your yard until the Consensus sits up and takes notice.</p>

<p><strong>Exactly When I Mean To:</strong> (You have this move by default) At the <strong>beginning of the session</strong>, roll +Entropic. On a 10+, hold 2. On a 7–9, hold 1. At any time, either you or the MC can spend your hold to have you arrive in a scene, with the proper tools and knowledge, with or without any clear explanation why. Take +1 forward when you do so. On a miss, the MC holds 1, and can spend it to have you arrive, but somehow pinned, caught or trapped.</p>
<p><strong>Call Through Shadow:</strong> When you <strong>call a mundane or common object to yourself</strong>, roll +Dynamic. On a hit, you have successfully summoned it to you. On a 10+ you’re in the clear. On a 7-9 choose 1:</p>

<p><strong>Magical Experimentation:</strong> When you collaborate with other Mages to <strong>push your magic past its current boundaries</strong> in a controlled setting, roll +Dynamic. On a 10+ all 3, on a 7-9 choose 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>It works pretty much as intended</li>
<li>It doesn’t cause a scene, draw extra attention, or harm you</li>
<li>It was controlled enough that you can repeat it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This One Is Mine:</strong> When you <strong>call out another magical being</strong>, so long as your companions don’t interfere, others will give you enough space to finish it, come what may.</p>

<p>The Inspired gets the <strong>Source</strong> move, and 2 other moves of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> (You have this move by default) You’ve identified the source of your inspiration. When <strong>your Source first becomes present in a scene</strong>, hold 3. At any time that your source is present for the rest of the scene, spend your Hold 1-for-1 to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw attention to your Source</li>
<li>Give someone (including yourself) +1 to a roll they just made if it would change the result, describing how your Source helps them do it</li>
