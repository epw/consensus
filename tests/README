These tests confirm some basic things about the PDFs generated by the
Makefile.

They require pdfminer installed for Python 3, which you can likely do
with:
  $ sudo pip3 install pdfminer

Run the tests with:
  $ python3 playbooks.py

Or just:
  $ make test

Which can even be done in the parent (project root) directory.

It would be nice to add some textual awareness in the future, checking
that notable phrases from the playbooks actually are in the PDFs. That
would avoid embarrassing mistakes like when Eric changed "Memory
Anchors" to "Emotional Anchors" and they disappeared from the
playbooks. In theory, this could be done by using the
playbook-processing code which extracts them from the Markdown, and
exporting that data into something that the tests can process.
