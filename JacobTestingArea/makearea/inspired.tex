\renewcommand{\MoveExplanation}{The Pious gets the \textbf{Source} move, and 2 other moves of your choice.}
\renewcommand{\Moves}{
  \setlength\itemsep{-.25em}
  \DEFAULTMOVE{Source}{You've identified the source of your inspiration. When \TRIGGER{your Source first becomes present in a scene}, hold 3. At any time that your source is present for the rest of the scene, spend your Hold 1-for-1 to:}


\MOVE{Just When I Think You're Gone}{When you \TRIGGER{pass up an opportunity to interact with your Source}, or remove it from a scene, roll +Within. On a hit, hold 1. On a 10+ you may spend your hold 1-for-1 to have your source appear in the scene with no explanation needed. On a 7-9 you may spend your hold for the same, but your Source is threatened, captured, or in peril.}

\MOVE{Open Their Mind}{When you \TRIGGER{introduce an individual to your Source to open their mind}, roll +Entropic. On a 10+, they are not a Lookout the next time they would be for your magic. On a 7-9, they are drawn to your Source (if a PC, they mark experience next time they interact with your Source). On a 6-, in addition to whatever else the MC says, choose one:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item They find they have a strong aversion to your Source
\item They wish to take your Source away from you.\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{Opiate for the Masses}{When you \TRIGGER{bring your Source to a mob}, roll +Without. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold 1-for-1 to:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item Discover a truth that they know
\item Obtain something of value or use
\item Get them to believe a truth
\item Learn their potential
\item Placate them and return them to their mundane lives.\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{Visions of Fate}{When you \TRIGGER{dive into the chaos surging around you to see visions of what could come to be}, roll +Entropic. On a 10+, pick one person who keeps their standing, and one who doesn't. On a 7-9, pick one or the other. Don't name a PC; name NPCs only. The MC will make your prediction come true, if it’s even remotely possible. On a miss, take -1 ongoing until the chaos subsides.}

}

\renewcommand{\SpecialMoveSpacing}{10em}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMove}{roll +Entropic. On a hit you count as having Opened Their Mind, as if you’d rolled a 10+. On a 7-9 they hold 1, and can spend that hold to have your Source show up in a scene, or deny it from you for a scene. On a 6-, if they are aware of the magical world, they gain a Restriction against magic with your Source.}

\renewcommand{\Paradigms}{
  \PARADIGM{I Bend the Rules through my Source}{Mental magic, Time-affecting magic  }\
  
           {(choose one) Magic that reenforces the status quo, magic that doesn't protect my Source  }\
