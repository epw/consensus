\renewcommand{\Moves}{
  \DEFAULTMOVE{Universal Programmer}{When you \TRIGGER{make a new piece of equipment}, roll +Dynamic. On a hit you make it. On a 10+, it works and keeps working. On a 7-9, it will only last for the scene. In either case, choose a quirk:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item The device works much more slowly than expected
\item The device requires more of a resource than expected
\item The device has a side effect when used\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{Read the Web of Fate}{When you \TRIGGER{enter the virtual world to Read the Web of Fate}, roll +Without. On a hit, you can determine the degrees of separation between two objects or people. On a 10+, you can also get a general idea of the path between them.}

\MOVE{Ghost in the Machine}{When you \TRIGGER{enter the Virtual World physically}, you may bring other willing Mages along, and exit at any terminal you can find.}

\MOVE{Things Speak}{When you examine an interesting technological or magical object, roll +Without. On a 10+, you may ask up to 3 of the following questions, on a 7-9, ask 1.\TRIGGER{}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item What strong emotions have been most recently associated with this?
\item Whatâ€™s wrong with this, and how might I fix it?
\item How frequently has this been handled?
\item Where did this come from?
\item How might this be dangerous?
\item Who designed this?\end{itemize}}

\MOVE{Percussive Maintenance}{When you \TRIGGER{impose your will on a machine}, roll +Entropic. It works better. On a 10+, tell the MC how. On a 7-9, the MC will tell you how. On a 6-, the MC will tell you how, and why this is terrible for you.}

}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMoveSpacing}{9em}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMove}{they speak to you as if they were an interesting technological or magical object (whether or not you have the move). Treat it as rolling a 10+ and ask up to 3 questions from the list. If you ask more than 1 question, you speak back to them in the same way, and they may ask up to 3 questions of the same list.}
