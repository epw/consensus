\renewcommand{\Moves}{
\DEFAULTMOVE{Source}{You've identified the source of your
  inspiration. When \TRIGGER{your Source first becomes present in a
    scene}, hold 3. At any time that your source is present for the
  rest of the scene, spend your Hold 1-for-1 to:
{\small
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
\item Draw attention to your Source
\item Give someone (including yourself) +1 to a roll they just made if
  it would change the result, describing how your Source helps them do
  it
\item Bring your positive tag into play, narrating what it means for
  the moment
\end{itemize}
}
}

{\small
\MOVE{Just When I Think You're Gone}{When you \TRIGGER{pass up an
    opportunity to interact with your Source of Inspiration, or remove
    it from a scene}, roll +Within. On a hit, hold 1. On a 10+ you may
  spend your hold 1-for-1 to have your source appear in the scene with
  no explanation needed. On a 7-9 you may spend your hold for the
  same, but your Source is threatened, captured, or in peril.}
}

\MOVE{Open Their Mind}{When you \TRIGGER{introduce an individual to
    your Source to open their mind}, roll +Entropic. On a 10+, they are
  not a lookout the next time they would be for your magic. On a 7-9,
  they are drawn to your Source (if a PC, they mark experience next
  time they interact with your Source). On a 6-, in addition to
  whatever else the MC says, choose one:
{\small
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
  \item They find they have a strong aversion to your Source
  \item They wish to take your Source away from you.
  \end{itemize}
}
}

\MOVE{Opiate for the Masses}{When you \TRIGGER{bring your Source to a
    mob}, roll +Without. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your
  hold 1-for-1 to:
  {\small
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
  \item Discover a truth that they know
  \item Obtain something of value or use
  \item Get them to believe a truth
  \item Learn their potential
  \item Placate them and return them to their mundane lives
  \end{itemize}
  }
}

\MOVE{Visions of Fate}{When you \TRIGGER{dive into the chaos
    surging around you to see visions of what could come to be}, roll
  +Entropic. On a 10+, pick one person who keeps their standing, and one
  who doesn't. On a 7-9, pick one or the other. Don't name a PC; name
  NPCs only. The MC will make your prediction come true, if it's even
  remotely possible. On a miss, take -1 ongoing until the chaos
  subsides.}

}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMoveSpacing}{-1em}
\renewcommand{\SpecialMove}{roll +Entropic. On a hit you count as
  having Opened Their Mind, as if you'd rolled a 10+. On a 7-9 they
  hold 1, and can spend that hold to have your Source show up in a
  scene, or deny it from you for a scene. On a 6-, if they are aware
  of the magical world, they gain a restriction against magic with
  your Source.}
\renewcommand{\Paradigms}{
\PARADIGM{I Bend the Rules through my Source}{Mental magic,
  Time-Affecting magic}{Choose one: Magic that reinforces the status
  quo, Magic that doesn’t Protect my Source}{Choose this one: Magic
  without my Source}

\PARADIGM{My Source Lets me See the True Nature of
  Things}{Divinations, Transmutations}{Choose one: Obscuring magic,
  Changing thing that are Static}{Choose one: Magic without my Source, Magic while
  Blind}
