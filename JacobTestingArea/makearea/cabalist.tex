\renewcommand{\PaneFive}{\SECTION{Your Cabal:}

By default there are about 5 in the Cabal, you don't control them and they don't control you. You're pretty close in your outlooks on the world, but not everything lines up completely. This is a small cabal, with weak magic.


Choose up to two of these:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item You actually are in charge, or at least you founded it. Strength: +loyal

  \item There's more than just a couple of you, maybe 10 or more. Medium cabal.

  \item You're part of a larger system, you're just one node in the leylines. Strength: +support

  \item Your cabal is strong of will. Drop weak magic

  \item Your cabal is very close. Strength: +family

  \end{itemize}

And choose one of these:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Your cabal doesn't keep a super low profile. Vulnerable: Target

  \item Your cabal owes something to someone, money, allegiance, an artifact, or the like. Vulnerable: Obligation

  \item Your cabal is anonymous and guarded about their identities. Vulnerable: Infiltration

  \end{itemize}
