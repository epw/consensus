#The biggest problem is that we would like to replace Secrets and
#Highlighting. Secrets are a somewhat clunky system, though they have
#provided good character backstory connections, and Highlighting isn't
#terribly interesting or thematic as a way to gain XP (and also, PCs
#have been gaining XP surprisingly quickly if they try).
This has been fixed by changing Secrets to Anchors, and changing Highlighting to Flags


#Aligned/unaligned magic doesn't seem great.
This was fixed by adding a bonus to Aligned, rather than a detriment to unaligned

#It is seeming like we need some kind of simple "money/other nonmagical
#resources" abstraction.
