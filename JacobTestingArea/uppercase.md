IN THE BEGINNING
================

CONSENSUS
---------

EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW THE WORLD WORKS. DROPPED THINGS FALL DOWN,
ELECTRICITY MOVES IN CIRCUITS, THERE'S NO WAY TO TRULY SHOW SOMEONE ELSE
AN IMAGE INSIDE YOUR HEAD. THIS IS THE CONSENSUS, THE AGREEMENT ABOUT
HOW REALITY WORKS.

A FEW PEOPLE, THOUGH, SEEM TO KNOW DIFFERENTLY. THEY MIGHT KNOW THAT AN
ANTENNA USES AN OPEN CIRCUIT TO MAKE INVISIBLE WAVES. OR THAT THE RIGHT
DRUMBEAT CAN LET THEM FOCUS A POINT BEHIND THEIR EYES INTO A PICTURE FOR
ANOTHER TO SEE. OR THE SECRET, FORGOTTEN WORD FROM THE DAWN OF HISTORY
THAT WHEN SPOKEN AS A COMMAND TELLS AN OBJECT TO IGNORE GRAVITY.

THESE PEOPLE ARE MAGES, THE AWAKENED WHO UNDERSTAND A TRUTH DIFFERENT
THAN THE CONSENSUS. THEY EXIST WITHIN IT, PLAYING BY ITS RULES WHEN THEY
HAVE TO, BUT ALWAYS KNOW THERE IS MORE. THAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IS POWER,
AND THAT KIND OF POWER CAN'T EXIST WITHOUT MAKING WAVES.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT IT IS TO BE ONE?

SETTING UP TO PLAY
------------------

FIRST OFF, YOU'LL NEED AROUND 3-6 PEOPLE, AND NOT JUST ANY PEOPLE,
YOU'LL NEED THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INTO THIS SORT OF THING. PEOPLE
WHO ENJOY PRETENDING, IMAGINING, AND PLAYING TOGETHER, AND PEOPLE THAT
CAN TRUST ONE ANOTHER. ONE TO BE THE MC, AND THE REST TO PLAY MAGES.
MORE THAN THAT AND IT WILL BE HARD TO KEEP EVERYONE INVOLVED AND KEEP
TRACK OF EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. EVERYONE SHOULD AT LEAST SKIM THIS
BOOK, AND THE MC SHOULD HAVE READ IT MORE THOROUGHLY.

YOU'LL NEED TO HAVE PRINTED ONE COPY OF EACH OF THE PLAYBOOKS, SEVERAL
COPIES OF THE BASIC AND ADVANCED MOVES, THE MC SHEET, AND THE CHARACTER
SUMMARY SHEET. YOU'LL ALSO NEED A FEW MORE PIECES OF BLANK PAPER.

YOU'LL NEED SOME PAIRS OF NORMAL, SIX-SIDED DICE (D6S, IF YOU PREFER).
IDEALLY, ONE PAIR FOR EVERY MAGE PLAYING. THE MC DOES NOT NEED DICE.
THIS ISN'T THAT KIND OF GAME.

TO GET STARTED, YOU'LL NEED SOMEWHERE REASONABLY FREE OF DISTRACTIONS
AND INTERRUPTIONS, WHERE EVERYONE CAN GET INTO CHARACTER AND START TO
IMAGINE TOGETHER. YOU'LL WANT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH SEATING AND A TABLE OF
SOME KIND TO PUT ALL THE PAPERS AND ROLL DICE ON, AND SO EVERYONE CAN
SEE EACH OTHER. SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO ADD TO THE AMBIANCE, WITH MUSIC,
CANDLES, INCENSE, GRIMOIRES, RAVENS' SKULLS, OR TESLA COILS. CONSENSUS
TENDS TO HAVE 6-12 SESSIONS, SO TRY TO FIND SOMEWHERE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
RETURN TO SEVERAL TIMES.

GAMES OF CONSENSUS OFTEN START TO BRING UP IMAGES AND SYMBOLS THAT FEEL
REAL WITHIN THE GAME. MATERIALS TO SHOW OR MAKE THEM, SUCH AS COLORED
PENCILS, CAN GO A LONG WAY.

FINALLY, GO TO THE FIRST SESSION CHAPTER, AND BEGIN TO FOLLOW ITS RULES.

ROLEPLAYING AS A CONVERSATION
-----------------------------

THIS IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME, IN WHICH PLAYERS TAKE ON THE ROLES OF
CHARACTERS IN A STORY AND DESCRIBE, TOGETHER, WHAT HAPPENS. ONE PLAYER,
THE MC, TENDS TO DESCRIBE THE WORLD, MOST PEOPLE IN IT, AND HOW THEY
RESPOND TO THE ACTIONS OF THE CHARACTERS PLAYED BY THE OTHER PLAYERS,
GETTING INPUT FROM THEM ON HOW THE WORLD LOOKS AND WORKS AS APPROPRIATE.
NONE OF THE PLAYERS ARE COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER, THOUGH CHARACTERS MAY
BE AT ODDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO TELL A STORY ABOUT WONDROUS
THINGS, AND TO HAVE PHILOSOPHICAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF
REALITY, AND ABOUT THE NATURE OF HUMANITY.

OVERALL, CONSENSUS WORKS BY HAVING ALL THE PLAYERS DESCRIBE A SETTING
TOGETHER. IT MIGHT BE A CITY, MUCH LIKE ONE MANY OF THEM KNOW, BUT
LIKELY WITH A DARKER, MORE SINISTER SLANT. IT MIGHT BE A QUIET TOWN WITH
SECRETS HIDDEN JUST UNDER THE SURFACE. WHATEVER IT IS, EVERYONE SHOULD
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S BASICALLY LIKE, ENOUGH THAT THEY COULD EASILY
DESCRIBE A STARTING POINT FOR A NEW SCENE, AND FEEL COMFORTABLE MAKING
UP SMALL DETAILS. EACH PLAYER EXCEPT THE MC ALSO DESCRIBES A MAGE, IN
MUCH GREATER DETAIL, FROM THE CLOTHES THEY WEAR TO THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT
THE UNIVERSE. DON'T WORRY, THE GAME HELPS YOU DO IT. THE MC ASKS
QUESTIONS TO HELP FLESH OUT BOTH THE WORLD AND THE CHARACTERS.

THEN, THE MC STARTS FRAMING SCENES, DESCRIBING SOMETHING THAT ENCOURAGES
ACTION FROM A FEW MAGES, AND ASKS, "WHAT DO YOU DO?" AT THIS POINT, A
CONVERSATION HAS BEGUN. YOU ANSWER, AND THE MC RESPONDS, BUILDING ON
WHAT YOU SAID, AND DRAWING IN OTHERS AT THE TABLE. THE RULES OF THE GAME
ADD DEPTH TO THE CONVERSATION, BRINGING UP POINTED QUESTIONS OR ADDING
NEW COMPLICATIONS TO THE STORY THAT'S DEVELOPING. THE RULES, AND DETAILS
ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER, CAN HELP PROMPT YOU WHERE YOU SHOULD GO NEXT, BUT
IN THE END, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DECIDES WHAT YOUR CHARACTER THINKS AND
DOES.

MOVES AND DICE
--------------

THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF A CONVERSATION IN A CLASSROOM MIGHT BE
QUESTION AND ANSWER. IN CONSENSUS, THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR
CONVERSATIONS ARE THE MOVES. ANY TIME THE PLAYERS LOOK TO THE MC TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, THE MC WILL RESPOND WITH ONE OF THEIR MOVES. WHEN THE
PLAYERS DESCRIBE WHAT THEIR CHARACTERS DO, IT WILL OFTEN TRIGGER ONE OF
THE BASIC MOVES OR ONE OF THE PLAYBOOK MOVES. THE STRUCTURE OF A MOVE IS
AS FOLLOWS: (MC MOVES ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND WILL BE EXPLAINED IN
DEPTH LATER)

THE TRIGGER: THIS PART WILL BE BOLDED ON THE MOVES SHEET OR PLAYBOOK. IT
TAKES THE FORM OF **"WHEN YOU \[DO SOMETHING\]"** AND MAY BE VERY
SPECIFIC OR MAY BE MORE BROAD. IN EITHER CASE, WHEN A PLAYER SAYS THAT
THEIR CHARACTER DOES SOMETHING THAT FITS ONE OF THESE MOVES, THE MC
SHOULD CALL FOR THEM TO ROLL IT. IF A PLAYER DOES NOT WISH TO ROLL THAT
MOVE, THEY SHOULD CHANGE THEIR NARRATION OF WHAT THEIR CHARACTER DOES SO
THAT IT DOES NOT TRIGGER THE MOVE. LIKEWISE, AS A PLAYER, YOU SHOULD
NEVER JUST SAY "I WANT TO ROLL \[MOVE\]," INSTEAD YOU MUST DESCRIBE YOUR
CHARACTER DOING SOMETHING THAT TRIGGERS THAT MOVE. YOU CAN NOT ROLL THE
MOVE WITHOUT YOUR CHARACTER TAKING THE ACTION THE TRIGGERS IT, AND YOU
CAN NOT HAVE YOUR CHARACTER TAKE AN ACTION THAT TRIGGERS A MOVE WITHOUT
ALSO ROLLING IT.

THE ROLL: MOST MOVES (BUT NOT ALL OF THEM) WILL HAVE A ROLL ASSOCIATED
WITH THEM. IT WILL TAKE THE FORM OF "ROLL +\[SOMETHING\]" USUALLY ONE OF
YOUR CHARACTER'S STATS. A ROLL IN CONSENSUS IS ALWAYS TWO DICE ADDED
TOGETHER, PLUS WHATEVER THE MOVE SAYS. REGULAR DICE WITH SIX SIDES AND
NUMBERS OR PIPS ON THEM. NOTHING FANCY OR WEIRD. (IF YOU WANT FANCY OR
WEIRD DICE, TAKE A LOOK AT OUR HACKING SECTION FOR SOME OPTIONS).

THE OUTCOME: IN CONSENSUS, A RESULT OF 10 OR HIGHER IS A FULL SUCCESS,
THE CHARACTER SHOULD SUCCEED AT WHAT THEY WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO. A ROLL
OF 7-9 IS A MIXED SUCCESS. THE CHARACTER SHOULD STILL SUCCEED, BUT AT
SOME COST. THEY MAY HAVE TO MAKE A HARD CHOICE, OR THEY MAY NOT SUCCEED
AS WELL AS THEY WOULD HAVE ON A 10+, THE MOVE WILL GIVE GUIDANCE. A ROLL
OF A 6- IS A FAILURE, AND MEANS THAT THE MC GETS TO MAKE A HARD MOVE.
(THIS IS A MOVE THAT CHANGES THE FICTION IRREVOCABLY AND CAN'T BE
PREVENTED, SUCH AS BREAKING A PIECE OF GEAR, HAVING SOMEONE SHOW UP TO
NOTICE YOUR HORRIFIC ACT AT JUST THE WRONG TIME, OR EVEN DEALING
DAMAGE). THIS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE CHARACTER HAS FAILED AT
WHAT THEY WERE SETTING OUT TO ACCOMPLISH THOUGH, THEY COULD SUCCEED AND
FIND OUT EXACTLY WHY SUCCEEDING WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE THING FOR THEM TO
DO. MOST MOVES WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS ON A 10+ OR A 7-9, AND
SOME WILL EVEN TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS ON A 6-.

STATS
-----

THE STATS IN CONSENSUS DESCRIBE THINGS ABOUT THE CHARACTER, WHAT THEY'RE
GOOD AT, AND WHAT PATTERNS THEY MIGHT REACH FOR FIRST IN ORDER TO SOLVE
A PROBLEM. STATS CAN BE IN THE RANGE OF -1 TO +3, AND ARE ADDED TO THE
DICE ROLLS FOR RELEVANT MOVES. THE SPECIFIC STATS USED IN CONSENSUS ARE:

STATIC: AS IN UNMOVABLE, STEADY, SET IN YOUR WAYS, AND CONSERVATIVE.
DYNAMIC: AS IN CREATIVE, FREE-FLOWING, ADAPTABLE, EASILY MOVED, AND
INVENTIVE. ENTROPIC: AS IN DIRECT, ACTIVE, UNSTOPPABLE, FORWARD, AND
DESTRUCTIVE. WITHIN: REFERRING TO THE INTERNAL SELF, CONTROLLED
REACTIONS, ABILITY TO INTROSPECT, AND KNOW YOURSELF. WITHOUT: REFERRING
TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD, CONNECTIONS, EMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING.

THE LIFE OF A MAGE
------------------

MAGES IN CONSENSUS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DEEP BELIEF ABOUT HOW THE WORLD
WORKS AND HOW THEY CAN FIT INTO IT. THIS BELIEF IS STRONG ENOUGH TO
ALLOW THEM TO DO WHAT THE GAME RECOGNIZES AS MAGIC, THOUGH THEY MAY DENY
THAT, BECAUSE IF THE WORLD REALLY WORKS BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO SPEAK
WORDS OF POWER TO COMMAND THE ELEMENTS, THEN SPEAKING THOSE WORDS OF
POWER ISN'T MAGIC ANY MORE THAN USING A COMPUTER IS. MAGES CHANGE THE
WORLD JUST BY EXISTING, WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, AND THESE CHANGES
FORM THE BASIS FOR MANY OF THE STORIES IN CONSENSUS.

### PARADIGM

A MAGE'S PARTICULAR BELIEFS ARE SUMMED UP IN THEIR PARADIGM. THIS
DESCRIBES WHAT IT IS THEY BELIEVE THAT IS DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM THE
USUAL WORLD THAT WHEN ACTED ON, THE MAGE PRODUCES MAGIC. IT SUGGESTS
WHAT THEY ARE GENERALLY CAPABLE OF, WHAT THEY ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD AT,
AND WHAT THEY THINK IS IMPOSSIBLE, WHETHER FOR JUST THEMSELVES OR FOR
ANYBODY. UNDERSTANDING THE DEPTHS OF THEIR OWN PARADIGM IS AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THE JOURNEY FOR ANY MAGE, AND UNDERSTANDING THE PARADIGMS OF
OTHER MAGES AROUND THEM IS KEY TO SUCCESSFULLY WORKING TOGETHER (AS WELL
AS TO NOT HAVE A DISASTROUS CLASH OF WORLDVIEWS).

SEE THE [MAGIC CHAPTER](MagicChapter) FOR MORE ON PARADIGMS.

### HARDSHIP BREEDS REVELATION

BELIEFS CAN BE MADE STRONGER BY BEING CHALLENGED, JUST LIKE PEOPLE. VERY
FEW PEOPLE WHO LEAD AN EASY, CHARMED, UNCHALLENGED LIFE DEVELOP THE
BELIEFS THAT ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO TRANSFORM THEM INTO A MAGE. BUT, ONCE
THEY DO AWAKEN, COMING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ABILITIES, THEIR STORY IS
JUST GETTING STARTED. DIFFICULTIES REMAIN, WHETHER THINGS THEY COULDN'T
SHAKE FROM THEIR PAST OR NEW PROBLEMS BROUGHT ON BY MAGIC. THE LIFE OF A
MAGE IS NEVER AN EASY ONE.

TO GET AT THIS, PLAYBOOKS ASK THREE QUESTIONS: WHY WAS YOUR HUMANITY
TRIVIALIZED, WHY IS YOUR HUMANITY STILL IN QUESTION, AND WHY ARE YOU
HUNTED. THESE CAN BE FAR-FETCHED AND FANTASTIC, BUT ALSO CAN BE TIED
VERY TIGHTLY TO REAL-WORLD ISSUES. BE RESPECTFUL AND CAREFUL, BUT DO
DELVE INTO THESE IF YOU WANT. [THE SAFETY RULES IN THE FIRST
SESSION](SafetyRules) CHAPTER CAN HELP MAKE SURE NO-ONE CROSSES A
BOUNDARY THEY DON'T WANT TO.

### ANCHORS AND INSPIRATIONS

MAGES, JUST LIKE ANYONE, ARE TIED TO PEOPLE AND THINGS AROUND THEM. SOME
OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TIES ARE TO ANCHORS, THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION
"WHY DID YOU STAY?". THESE NONMAGICAL PEOPLE, PLACES, AND THINGS HOLD A
MAGE BACK FROM THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, BUT ALSO KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING
LOST. THEY REQUIRE UPKEEP, SINCE PEOPLE HAVE NEEDS, APARTMENTS NEED
RENT, AND TRADITIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED. IF NOT SEEN TO OFTEN ENOUGH, THEY
WILL STOP ANCHORING THE MAGE, LEAVING THEM THAT MUCH CLOSER TO TRUE
POWER, OR TO DISCONNECTING ENTIRELY FROM THE WORLD. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE
TO LOSE AN ANCHOR IN ONE SEARING MOMENT, WHEN IT BECOMES CLEAR THEY
DIDN'T MATTER TO YOU LIKE YOU THOUGHT THEY DID (OR THEY DIE, ARE BROKEN,
OR LOST).

INSPIRATIONS ARE THE PEOPLE, AND OCCASIONALLY MAGICAL BEINGS, WHO
FURTHER ENLIGHTEN A MAGE AND HELP THEM SEE WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE. THEY
ACT AS COUNTERBALANCES TO THE RESTRAINT FROM ANCHORS. AN INSPIRATION
DOESN'T TEND TO ACTIVELY INSPIRE FOR LONG, BUT THEY ARE EASY TO
RECONNECT WITH, WHICH CAN BE VERY REWARDING.

SEE THE ANCHORS AND INSPIRATIONS CHAPTER FOR MORE.

GEAR AND ACCOUTREMENTS
----------------------

A MAGE IS HOPEFULLY CAPABLE ENOUGH WHEN ARMED ONLY WITH THEIR MIND, BUT
OFTEN WILL HAVE A VARIETY OF SUPPLEMENTS TO DRAW ON. THEY TEND TO HAVE A
FEW PIECES OF NOTEWORTHY GEAR THAT USUALLY TRAVELS WITH THEM. IN
ADDITION, THEY MAY HAVE ACCESS TO A SPECIAL MAGICAL PLACE, OR A BAND OF
OTHER MAGES TO WORK WITH, OR A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO SEEK TO LEARN THEIR
WISDOM. FOR MORE ON THESE THINGS, SEE THE GEAR AND ACCOUTREMENTS
CHAPTER.

STATUS TRACKS
-------------

CONSENSUS MEASURES PROGRESS OVER TIME FOR A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF THE
GAME, FROM HEALTH TO A SINISTER PLOT. THIS IS USUALLY DONE WITH A STATUS
TRACK, WHICH IS BASED ON THE CODE SYSTEM USED IN MEDICAL TRANSPORT.
STATUS TRACKS START WITH NO CODES MARKED OFF, THEN HAVE CODE 50 MARKED
OFF, CODE 40, AND SO ON, DOWN TO CODE 10 AND THEN CODE N, THE
"NEWSWORTHY EVENT." WHAT THIS MEANS WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THE STATUS TRACK
IS TIED TO, BUT CODE N IS ALWAYS IRREVOCABLE, REPRESENTING A FUNDAMENTAL
CHANGE. WHEN A STATUS TRACK'S CODE 30 IS MARKED OFF, IT STARTS TO
"SLIP", ADVANCING TOWARDS CODE N MUCH MORE QUICKLY. PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T
ADDRESSED EARLY ON CAN BECOME MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO HEAD OFF.

FOR MORE ON STATUS TRACKS, SEE THE STATUS TRACKS CHAPTER.

WHY TO PLAY
-----------

MAYBE YOU WANT TO FEEL WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEIZE SPIRITS
BY THEIR NAMES AND COMMAND THEM. MAYBE YOU LIKE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER
SOULS EXIST AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF THEY DID, AND WANT TO TRY OUT
BEING SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THEY DO, CAN ACT ON THEM, BUT STILL STAYS UP
LATE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS. MAYBE YOU HEAR POWER CORRUPTS, BUT
WANT TO PLAY OUT STRUGGLING BETWEEN THAT AND USING POWER TO DO GOOD.
MAYBE MAGES SOUND LIKE THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH,
AND THINK LIKE, AND THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD WAY TO TRY IT OUT.

MAYBE YOU'VE FELT LIKE YOU REALIZED SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORLD, AND
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMETHING THAT SAYS IT'S REAL, FOR A LONG TIME.

MISS, THE MC HOLDS 1, AND CAN SPEND IT TO HAVE YOU ARRIVE, BUT SOMEHOW
PINNED, CAUGHT OR TRAPPED.

**CALL THROUGH SHADOW:** WHEN YOU **CALL A MUNDANE OR COMMON OBJECT TO
YOURSELF**, ROLL +DYNAMIC. ON A HIT, YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED IT
TO YOU. ON A 10+ YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR. ON A 7-9 CHOOSE 1:

A 10+, GIVE THEM A NEW ALIGNED RELATED TO WHAT YOU TOLD THEM UNTIL THE
END OF SESSION.

**MAGICAL EXPERIMENTATION:** WHEN YOU COLLABORATE WITH OTHER MAGES TO
**PUSH YOUR MAGIC PAST ITS CURRENT BOUNDARIES** IN A CONTROLLED SETTING,
ROLL +DYNAMIC. ON A 10+ ALL 3, ON A 7-9 CHOOSE 1:

-   IT WORKS PRETTY MUCH AS INTENDED
-   IT DOESN'T CAUSE A SCENE, DRAW EXTRA ATTENTION, OR HARM YOU
-   IT WAS CONTROLLED ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN REPEAT IT.

**THIS ONE IS MINE:** WHEN YOU **CALL OUT ANOTHER MAGICAL BEING**, SO
LONG AS YOUR COMPANIONS DON'T INTERFERE, OTHERS WILL GIVE YOU ENOUGH
SPACE TO FINISH IT, COME WHAT MAY.

MANY PEOPLE WONDER WHERE INSPIRATION COMES FROM. THAT QUESTION IS BORING

WITH THAT INSPIRATION?

**NAME:** ESIN, TOBIAS, TAFARI, SAMEAL, MAB, FIONA, KAI, KENDALL,

(CHOOSE ONE) MAGIC WITHOUT MY SOURCE, MAGIC WHILE BLIND

### MOVES

THE INSPIRED GETS THE **SOURCE** MOVE, AND 2 OTHER MOVES OF YOUR CHOICE.

**SOURCE:** (YOU HAVE THIS MOVE BY DEFAULT) YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE
OF YOUR INSPIRATION. WHEN **YOUR SOURCE FIRST BECOMES PRESENT IN A
SCENE**, HOLD 3. AT ANY TIME THAT YOUR SOURCE IS PRESENT FOR THE REST OF
THE SCENE, SPEND YOUR HOLD 1-FOR-1 TO:

-   DRAW ATTENTION TO YOUR SOURCE
-   GIVE SOMEONE (INCLUDING YOURSELF) +1 TO A ROLL THEY JUST MADE IF IT
    WOULD CHANGE THE RESULT, DESCRIBING HOW YOUR SOURCE HELPS THEM DO IT
-   BRING YOUR POSITIVE TAG INTO PLAY, NARRATING WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE
    MOMENT

WHETHER IT IS PRESENT IN A SCENE OR NOT, YOUR SOURCE ALWAYS COUNTS AS AN
ACTIVE INSPIRATION FOR YOU.

**JUST WHEN I THINK YOU'RE GONE:** WHEN YOU **PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO
INTERACT WITH YOUR SOURCE**, OR REMOVE IT FROM A SCENE, ROLL +WITHIN. ON
A HIT, HOLD 1. ON A 10+ YOU MAY SPEND YOUR HOLD 1-FOR-1 TO HAVE YOUR
SOURCE APPEAR IN THE SCENE WITH NO EXPLANATION NEEDED. ON A 7-9 YOU MAY
SPEND YOUR HOLD FOR THE SAME, BUT YOUR SOURCE IS THREATENED, CAPTURED,
OR IN PERIL.

**OPEN THEIR MIND:** WHEN YOU **INTRODUCE AN INDIVIDUAL TO YOUR SOURCE
TO OPEN THEIR MIND**, ROLL +ENTROPIC. ON A 10+, THEY ARE NOT A LOOKOUT
THE NEXT TIME THEY WOULD BE FOR YOUR MAGIC. ON A 7-9, THEY ARE DRAWN TO
YOUR SOURCE (IF A PC, THEY MARK EXPERIENCE NEXT TIME THEY INTERACT WITH
YOUR SOURCE). ON A 6-, IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER ELSE THE MC SAYS, CHOOSE
ONE:

-   THEY FIND THEY HAVE A STRONG AVERSION TO YOUR SOURCE
-   THEY WISH TO TAKE YOUR SOURCE AWAY FROM YOU.

**OPIATE FOR THE MASSES:** WHEN YOU **BRING YOUR SOURCE TO A MOB**, ROLL
+WITHOUT. ON A 10+, HOLD 3. ON A 7-9, HOLD 1. SPEND YOUR HOLD 1-FOR-1
TO:

-   DISCOVER A TRUTH THAT THEY KNOW
-   OBTAIN SOMETHING OF VALUE OR USE
-   GET THEM TO BELIEVE A TRUTH
-   LEARN THEIR POTENTIAL
-   PLACATE THEM AND RETURN THEM TO THEIR MUNDANE LIVES.

**VISIONS OF FATE:** WHEN YOU **DIVE INTO THE CHAOS SURGING AROUND YOU
TO SEE VISIONS OF WHAT COULD COME TO BE**, ROLL +ENTROPIC. ON A 10+,
PICK ONE PERSON WHO KEEPS THEIR STANDING, AND ONE WHO DOESN'T. ON A 7-9,
PICK ONE OR THE OTHER. DON'T NAME A PC; NAME NPCS ONLY. THE MC WILL MAKE
YOUR PREDICTION COME TRUE, IF IT'S EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE. ON A MISS,
TAKE -1 ONGOING UNTIL THE CHAOS SUBSIDES.

YOU ALSO HAVE THIS MOVE:

WHEN YOU AND ANOTHER CHARACTER **EXCHANGE A MOMENT OF HUMANITY**, ROLL
+ENTROPIC. ON A HIT YOU COUNT AS HAVING OPENED THEIR MIND, AS IF YOU'D
ROLLED A 10+. ON A 7-9 THEY HOLD 1, AND CAN SPEND THAT HOLD TO HAVE YOUR
SOURCE SHOW UP IN A SCENE, OR DENY IT FROM YOU FOR A SCENE. ON A 6-, IF
THEY ARE AWARE OF THE MAGICAL WORLD, THEY GAIN A RESTRICTION AGAINST
MAGIC WITH YOUR SOURCE.

ANTAGONIZE

### MOVES

THE TECH ADEPT GETS THE **UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMER** MOVE, AND 2 OTHER MOVES
OF YOUR CHOICE.

**UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMER:** (YOU HAVE THIS MOVE BY DEFAULT) WHEN YOU
**MAKE A NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT**, ROLL +DYNAMIC. ON A HIT YOU MAKE IT.
ON A 10+, IT WORKS AND KEEPS WORKING. ON A 7-9, IT WILL ONLY LAST FOR
THE SCENE. IN EITHER CASE, CHOOSE A QUIRK:

-   THE DEVICE WORKS MUCH MORE SLOWLY THAN EXPECTED
-   THE DEVICE REQUIRES MORE OF A RESOURCE THAN EXPECTED
-   THE DEVICE HAS A SIDE EFFECT WHEN USED

**READ THE WEB OF FATE:** WHEN YOU **ENTER THE VIRTUAL WORLD TO READ THE
WEB OF FATE**, ROLL +WITHOUT. ON A HIT, YOU CAN DETERMINE THE DEGREES OF
SEPARATION BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS OR PEOPLE. ON A 10+, YOU CAN ALSO GET A
GENERAL IDEA OF THE PATH BETWEEN THEM.

**GHOST IN THE MACHINE:** WHEN YOU **ENTER THE VIRTUAL WORLD
PHYSICALLY**, YOU MAY BRING OTHER WILLING MAGES ALONG, AND EXIT AT ANY
TERMINAL YOU CAN FIND.

**THINGS SPEAK:** WHEN YOU EXAMINE AN INTERESTING TECHNOLOGICAL OR
MAGICAL OBJECT, ROLL +WITHOUT. ON A 10+, YOU MAY ASK UP TO 3 OF THE
FOLLOWING QUESTIONS, ON A 7-9, ASK 1.

-   WHAT STRONG EMOTIONS HAVE BEEN MOST RECENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS?
-   WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS, AND HOW MIGHT I FIX IT?
-   HOW FREQUENTLY HAS THIS BEEN HANDLED?
-   WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?
-   HOW MIGHT THIS BE DANGEROUS?
-   WHO DESIGNED THIS?

**PERCUSSIVE MAINTENANCE:** WHEN YOU **IMPOSE YOUR WILL ON A MACHINE**,
ROLL +ENTROPIC. IT WORKS BETTER. ON A 10+, TELL THE MC HOW. ON A 7-9,
THE MC WILL TELL YOU HOW. ON A 6-, THE MC WILL TELL YOU HOW, AND WHY
THIS IS TERRIBLE FOR YOU.

YOU ALSO HAVE THIS MOVE:

WHEN YOU AND ANOTHER CHARACTER **EXCHANGE A MOMENT OF HUMANITY**, THEY
SPEAK TO YOU AS IF THEY WERE AN INTERESTING TECHNOLOGICAL OR MAGICAL
OBJECT (WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE MOVE). TREAT IT AS ROLLING A 10+ AND
ASK UP TO 3 QUESTIONS FROM THE LIST. IF YOU ASK MORE THAN 1 QUESTION,
YOU SPEAK BACK TO THEM IN THE SAME WAY, AND THEY MAY ASK UP TO 3
QUESTIONS OF THE SAME LIST.

ON A 7-9, THEY WILL NEED SOME PROOF OR ASSURANCES FIRST.

**ARRESTING VOICE:** WHEN YOU **USE YOUR VOICE TO DELIVER A MESSAGE THAT

THE MOVES
=========

THE BASIC MOVES
---------------

WHEN YOU **ASSERT YOUR PARADIGM** OVER ANOTHER MAGE'S, ROLL +STATIC (-1
IF TETHERED). ON A 10+, HOLD 3, OR ON A 7-9, HOLD 1. YOU CAN SPEND YOUR
HOLD 1 FOR 1 TO: - HAVE THEM MARK EXPERIENCE (IF AN NPC, THEY COMPLY
WITH A REASONABLE REQUEST) - GIVE THEM A +1 OR -1 ON THEIR NEXT ROLL (IF
AN NPC, ENHANCE OR COUNTER THEIR NEXT USE OF MAGIC) - CAUSE THEIR
CURRENT DISCORD TO BACKLASH. - OFFER YOURSELF AS AN INSPIRATION TO THEIR
CHARACTER (THEY DO NOT NEED TO ACCEPT) ON A MISS, THEY HOLD 1 AGAINST
YOU, ON THE SAME TERMS.

> THIS MOVE IS ONE THAT SERVES MULTIPLE PURPOSES. SOMETIMES A MAGE IS
> EXPLICITLY TRYING TO CONVINCE ANOTHER MAGE ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS,
> ANIMATEDLY OR EVEN VIOLENTLY. THEY ARE ASSERTING THAT THEIR PARADIGM
> IS CORRECT. HOWEVER, THIS MOVE COMES UP EVEN MORE DURING DEEP
> PHILOSOPHICAL CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN MAGES, WHERE THEY COMPARE VIEWS ON
> THE WORLD, MORALITY, AND MAGIC. THE HOLD FROM THIS MOVE CAN FLOW
> FREELY, AND YOU CAN USE IT TO HELP, HINDER, BRIBE, OR THREATEN ANOTHER
> MAGE.

WHEN YOU **IMPRESS A LUSUS NATURAE WITH A FEAT OF MAGIC IN ORDER TO SWAY
THEM,** THEY WILL EXPECT SOMETHING IN RETURN. ROLL +WITHOUT (-1 IF
TETHERED). ON A 10+, THEY WILL DO WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU PROMISE TO DO IT.
ON A 7-9 THEY MAY CHOOSE TO INSTEAD: - GIVE YOU SOMETHING ELSE THEY
THINK YOU WANT OR NEED - MAKE THEMSELVES SCARCE - REQUIRE YOU TO FULFILL
THE PROMISE BEFORE THEY HELP.

> THERE MIGHT BE OTHER BEINGS IN THE WORLD BESIDES SIMPLE HUMANS (SOME
> OF WHOM ARE MAGES). GHOSTS, DEMONS, PERHAPS EVEN MORE ESOTERIC
> CREATURES LIKE VAMPIRES AND FAERIES, AND THE ARTIFACTS OF CREATION
> LIKE GOLEMS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES. SOME MAGES LUMP THEM ALL
> INTO A CATEGORY OF LUSUS NATURAE. THEY EXIST HIDDEN IN FORGOTTEN
> CORNERS OF THE CONSENSUS, NOT ABLE TO STEP OUTSIDE IT LIKE MAGES, BUT
> DENIED BY THE COMMON LOOKOUT. THEY HAVE AT LEAST A DIM UNDERSTANDING
> OF A MAGE'S RAW POWER, AND A DISPLAY OF IT IS THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST
> WAY TO CONVINCE THEM OF SOMETHING. THEY CAN BE INSCRUTABLE, HOWEVER,
> AND HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDAS. THEY ALSO MAY FIND MAGES TO BE
> INSCRUTABLE, AND SOMETIMES WILL TRY TO HELP IN THEIR OWN WAY, OR
> SIMPLY GET OUT OF THE MAGE'S PATH, RATHER THAN FACE POTENTIAL WRATH.

WHEN YOU **USE A SLEEPER** FOR YOUR OWN ENDS, YOU MUST FIRST PRESENT
SOMETHING THEY WANT. ROLL +WITHOUT. ON A 10+, THEY WILL DO WHAT YOU WANT
TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES, BUT ON A 7-9, THEY'LL NEED PROOF THAT
THEY'LL GET WHAT THEY WANT, OR THEY'LL NEED IT BEFORE THEY DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU.

> WHETHER YOUR MAGE VIEWS THE MASSES AS PAWNS TO BE USED, INDIVIDUALS TO
> BE SAVED, OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN, SOMETIMES THEY WILL REALLY NEED A
> SLEEPER TO DO SOMETHING THAT THE SLEEPER WOULD RATHER NOT DO. THAT'S
> WHERE THIS MOVE COMES IN. TAKE NOTE THAT "SOMETHING THEY WANT" CAN BE
> IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT, AND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PHYSICAL OR MATERIAL.
> IF YOU ROLL A 10+, AWESOME, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER TO KEEP YOUR WORD
> AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT. ON A 7-9, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU
> KEEP YOUR WORD, BEFORE YOU HELP.

WHEN YOU **HELP OR HINDER ANOTHER PC**, ROLL +ANCHORS. ON A 10+ THEY GET
A +1 OR -2 TO THEIR ROLL, YOUR CHOICE. ON A 7-9 THEY STILL GET THE BONUS
OR PENALTY, BUT YOU OPEN YOURSELF TO COST, DANGER, OR RETRIBUTION. IF
THEY ARE DOING MAGIC THAT IS ALIGNED TO YOUR PARADIGM, YOU MAY INSTEAD
HAVE THEM TREAT THE RESULT AS ONE CATEGORY HIGHER OR LOWER.

> OFTEN WHEN THE MC CALLS FOR A ROLL ON A SPECIFIC MOVE, IT WON'T BE
> JUST ONE OF THE PLAYERS' MAGES WHO ARE INVOLVED. BUT IT CAN GET MESSY
> TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT DIFFERENT MOVES TO TRIGGER FOR ALL OF THEM, SO IF
> THEY ARE DIRECTLY HELPING OR HINDERING THE PROCESS, THIS MOVE SHOULD
> BE CALLED FOR. PLAYERS MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOW THEIR MAGE WOULD HELP,
> IF THEY WANT TO HELP OUT ON A ROLL, AND THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE
> TRIGGERED AND ROLLED BEFORE THE MOVE THAT IT IS MODIFYING. IT CAN FEEL
> GOOD TO HELP OUT, BUT DOING SO MEANS GETTING INVOLVED, WHICH ALWAYS
> COMES WITH ITS OWN RISKS.

WHEN YOU **SELL A LIE** (TO A PERSON OR TO THE CONSENSUS), EXPLAIN WHY
THEY MIGHT BELIEVE IT AND ROLL +DYNAMIC. ON A 10+, YOU'VE DONE IT, WITH
NO-ONE THE WISER. ON A 7-9 YOU ONLY MOSTLY GET AWAY WITH IT; THE MC WILL
OFFER YOU A HARD BARGAIN, WORSE OUTCOME, OR TOUGH CHOICE.

> THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX MOVES IN THE GAME, AND ALSO ONE OF THE
> MOST VERSATILE. ANY TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO SLIP SOMETHING BY A PERSON
> IN CONVERSATION, OR OTHERWISE TRICK THEM, THIS IS THE MOVE TO GO TO.
> ANY TIME YOU TRY TO SLIP A SUBTLE, HARMONIOUS MAGICAL EFFECT PAST THE
> FILTERS OF REALITY, THIS IS THE MOVE TO GO TO. PRETTY MUCH ANY MAGIC
> THAT DOESN'T FIT INTO ONE OF THE OTHER MOVES PROBABLY CAN FIT INTO
> THIS ONE.

WHEN YOU OUTFOX, OUTPACE, OR OUTMANEUVER TO AVOID A DANGER, NAME YOUR
GAMBIT AND ROLL +DYNAMIC. ON A 10+, YOU PULL IT OFF, JUST AS DESCRIBED.
ON A 7-9 CHOOSE 1: - YOU OVEREXTEND YOURSELF IN THE PROCESS - YOU COME
AWAY WITH SOMETHING MISSING - SOMEONE ELSE IS DRAWN IN.

> THIS MOVE IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
> SOMETHING QUICKLY, OR CRAFTILY. THE MC MIGHT CALL FOR THIS MOVE WHEN
> YOU'RE TRYING TO OUTPACE A ROGUE MAGE IN A FOOT-RACE, OR WHEN YOU'RE
> TRYING TO AVOID AUTOMAGICAL COUNTERMEASURES ON THAT MACHINE YOU JUST
> JACKED YOURSELF INTO. THIS MOVE WILL SAVE YOUR BACON A HUNDRED TIMES
> OVER BEFORE YOU'RE DONE WITH IT.

WHEN YOU **KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN TO AVOID ATTENTION,** ROLL +WITHIN. ON A
10+, YOU AVOID NOTICE, SUSPICION, OR DETECTION. ON A 7-9, SOMEONE ON THE
ALERT NOTICES YOU. CHOOSE ONE: - OFFER THEM SOMETHING TO IGNORE YOU -
BACK OFF WITHOUT AROUSING FURTHER SUSPICION - CHOOSE WHEN AND WHERE YOU
ARE NOTICED.

> MAGES DON'T ALWAYS TRY TO TAKE UP SPACE AND MAKE NOISE. SOMETIMES,
> THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO ESCAPE NOTICE. THIS CAN TAKE MANY FORMS, FROM
> CLOAKING ONE'S AURA, TO AN ACTUAL INVISIBILITY SPELL, TO SIMPLY
> WEARING DARK CLOTHES AT NIGHT. EVEN IF YOU ARE SPOTTED, YOU USUALLY
> HAVE A FEW OPTIONS BEFORE THE WHOLE GAME IS GIVEN AWAY.

WHEN YOU **DO RENDING MAGIC** AND IT AFFECTS A LOOKOUT, GAIN 2 DISCORD,
BACKLASH, AND ROLL JUST +NOTHING (THE CONSENSUS DOESN'T CARE HOW SMART
OR SEXY YOU ARE). ON A 10+ CHOOSE UP TO 3, ON A 7-9 CHOOSE EXACTLY 2. -
YOU ONLY GAIN 1 DISCORD - YOU DON'T BACKLASH - YOU DON'T CAUSE
COLLATERAL DAMAGE - YOU DON'T ADD A RESTRICTION TO YOUR PARADIGM. ON A
MISS, CHOOSE ONE, BUT NOT "YOU DON'T BACKLASH."

> HERE'S THE THING ABOUT MAGIC THAT RENDS HOLES IN REALITY. IT JUST
> WORKS, BUT NEVER WITHOUT A PRICE. IT'S NOTEWORTHY HERE THAT
> "AFFECTING" A LOOKOUT MEANS EVEN IN THE BROADEST SENSE. DID YOU
> PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFT A HOMUNCULUS THAT HELPS OUT IN YOUR WORKSHOP? THAT
> MIGHT BE JUST FINE, UNTIL A LOOKOUT SEES IT. DID YOU MAKE MONEY APPEAR
> OUT OF THIN AIR? FINE, UNTIL YOU SPEND IT. ONCE A LOOKOUT IS AFFECTED,
> THE CONSENSUS CATCHES UP WITH YOU QUICK. IF YOU'RE VERY LUCKY, YOU CAN
> ESCAPE SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES, BUT NEVER ALL OF THEM, AND NEVER
> FOREVER.

WHEN YOU **DO MAGIC THAT IS ALIGNED TO YOUR PARADIGM** AND ROLL A 12+,
TAKE NARRATIVE CONTROL BRIEFLY TO DESCRIBE HOW IT WORKS ABOVE AND BEYOND
YOUR EXPECTATIONS, AND HOW THAT GOES WELL FOR YOU.

> ALIGNED MAGIC REPRESENTS A MAGE'S REAL SPECIALTY, THE KIND OF THING
> THAT JUST COMES NATURALLY TO THEM. IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THEIR PRIMARY
> FOCUS, BUT WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES, EVERYTHING TENDS
> TO GO BETTER. THIS MOVE MAKES THAT REAL. ROLLING A 12+ WHILE DOING
> ALIGNED MAGIC IS LIKE THE STARS ALIGNING, JUST A LITTLE BIT. DON'T GO
> OVERBOARD WITH THE RESULTS - A HEALING SPELL ISN'T GOING TO SUDDENLY
> RAISE THE DEAD INSTEAD. BUT IT'S THE PLEASURE OF A PAINTING THAT COMES
> OUT SO WELL IT'S BOUGHT BY A COLLECTOR ON THE SPOT, OR A PROTECTION
> SPELL THAT WILL LAST FOR EIGHT DAYS INSTEAD OF JUST THE ONE, OR A
> WEBSITE THAT REVEALS YOU HAVE A LOT MORE SUPPORTERS THAN YOU REALIZED.

WHEN YOU **ENACT SUDDEN, VIOLENT, OR UNEXPECTED CHANGE ON THE PHYSICAL
WORLD**, ROLL +ENTROPIC. ON A 10+, CHOOSE 3. ON A 7-9, CHOOSE 2: - YOU
ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO - YOU AREN'T INJURED IN THE PROCESS -
YOU DON'T CAUSE ANY COLLATERAL DAMAGE - YOU IMPRESS OR DISMAY THE TARGET
OR AN ONLOOKER, AND TAKE +1 FORWARD INTERACTING WITH THEM.

> MAGES DO NOT JUST EXIST IN AN ABSTRACT WORLD OF THE MIND. SOMETIMES,
> THEY HAVE TO ACT, TO REALLY CHANGE SOMETHING, AND FAST. WITH ENOUGH
> PREPARATION AND CONTROL, MOST SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE MITIGATED. WITHOUT
> MUCH PREPARATION OR CONTROL, THIS MOVE HAPPENS INSTEAD. IT IS RISKY,
> POTENTIALLY FAR-REACHING, AND OFTEN NOT THE BEST CHOICE.
>
> THIS MOVE DOES APPLY IN PARTICULAR TO STRAIGHT UP, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.
> MOST MAGES KNOW BETTER THAN TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE, AND KNOW THE

> QUICKLY, BEFORE THEIR OR SOMEONE ELSE'S LUCK RUNS OUT.

WHEN YOU **BACKLASH,** YOU PUSHED REALITY TOO FAR AND IT PUSHED BACK.
ANY EFFECTS BESIDES HARM WILL BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX WITH
MAGIC, PARTICULARLY THE TYPE OF MAGIC THAT CAUSED IT. ROLL JUST
+DISCORD, THEN RESET DISCORD TO 0. ON A 10+, REALITY BREAKS AROUND YOU A
LITTLE BIT. MAKE A STATUS TRACK FOR THIS BREAK, AND THE MC WILL MAKE ONE
TO TRACK IF YOU BECOME CONVINCED IT IS REAL. DECIDE ITS FORM: PERVASIVE
HALLUCINATIONS, A FANTASY WORLD OVERLAYING THE REAL ONE, OR A POCKET
DIMENSION YOU FALL INTO. CHOOSE A TRAIT OF YOUR PARADIGM (THE NAME,
ALIGNED, OR AN OPPOSED) TO BE EXPLORED BY THE BREAK, AND WRITE A MOVE TO
ADVANCE ITS STATUS TRACK. ON A 7-9, CHOOSE 2: - YOU TAKE 3 HARM - YOU
DON'T RESET YOUR DISCORD TO 0 - A PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF YOUR
DISCORD MANIFESTS; THE CONSENSUS MAKES LIFE NOTICEABLY INCONVENIENT FOR
YOU FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SESSION - THE CONSENSUS MANIFESTS A BEING,
AN ENFORCER OF ITS WILL, TO HUNT YOU DOWN, ATTACK YOU, OR OTHERWISE WARN
YOU TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR ON A MISS, YOU SHAKE IT OFF WITH MINIMAL
LASTING EFFECTS.

THE ADVANCED MOVES
------------------

WHEN YOU FAIL A ROLL ON A MAGICAL ACTION AND DECIDE TO **PUT WILLPOWER
BEHIND CHANGING IT**, THE MC MAY ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS. ANSWER THEM
HONESTLY. RE-ROLL THE ROLL WITH +1 AND CHOOSE 2: - SEVER YOUR CONNECTION
TO AN ANCHOR - TAKE -1 ONGOING UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY FAIL A MAGICAL ROLL -
YOU BACKLASH.

> SOMETIMES THE MC CALLS FOR A ROLL, SNAKE EYES SHOW UP ON THE DICE, AND
> YOU FEEL A SENSE OF DREAD ABOUT WHERE THE STORY IS GOING FOR YOUR
> MAGE. OR OTHER TIMES YOU JUST THINK IT WOULD BE MORE FUN TO TRY AGAIN.
> THIS MOVE IS A WAY TO RE-ROLL ANY MAGIC THAT YOU DO, AT A VERY LARGE
> COST. IT IS RARELY WORTH IT, AND THE MCS QUESTIONS WILL LIKELY REVOLVE
> AROUND WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOUR MAGE THAT THEY SUCCEED, THAT
> THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE SUCH RISKS AND PUT THEIR WILL BEHIND CHANGING
> THE OUTCOME OF FATE.

WHEN YOU FAIL A ROLL WITH NO MAGICAL INFLUENCE, AND DECIDE TO **USE
MAGIC TO FIX IT,** TREAT THE RESULT PLUS YOUR STAT AS A 7, AND CHOOSE 2:
- TAKE 2 HARM, OR 2 DISCORD - THE MAGIC IS RENDING - LOSE A PLAYBOOK
MOVE UNTIL THE END OF SESSION. - EXPEND YOUR PREPARATIONS (THIS COUNTS
AS TWO CHOICES)

> MAGES DON'T ALWAYS USE MAGIC. NO REALLY, THEY DON'T, IF THEY DID
> THEY'D BE ON A SHORT PATH TO NO LONGER BEING OF THIS WORLD. (TAKE THAT
> HOW YOU WILL.) BUT SOMETIMES, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE DOING THINGS THE
> NORMAL, MUNDANE WAY, THEY USE THEIR LITTLE BITS OF MAGIC TO GET AN
> EDGE OR FIX A MISTAKE. IF THEY'VE PREPARED FOR IT, GREAT, THAT'S WHY
> THEY HAVE CHARMS THEY SAY EVERY MORNING BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE HOUSE,
> OR WEAR THEIR LUCKY ENCHANTED HANDKERCHIEF. IF THEY'RE NOT PREPARED,
> IT CAN BE COSTLY, BUT EVEN THEN SOMETIMES THEY FEEL LIKE IT IS
> NECESSARY. EITHER WAY, MAKE SURE TO DESCRIBE EITHER THE MAGIC YOU'D
> PREPARED AHEAD OF TIME FOR A SITUATION JUST LIKE THIS, OR THE MAGIC
> THAT YOU DO SPUR OF THE MOMENT AND WHY IT CAUSES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL
> DOWNSIDES.

WHEN YOU **SUFFER HARM** (EVEN 0 HARM), ROLL JUST +HARM SUFFERED. ON A
10+, THE MC CAN CHOOSE 1: - YOU'RE OUT OF ACTION: UNCONSCIOUS, TRAPPED,
INCOHERENT, OR PANICKED. - TAKE THE FULL HARM OF THE ATTACK, BEFORE IT
WAS REDUCED BY PREPARATIONS. IF YOU ALREADY TOOK THE FULL HARM OF THE
ATTACK, TAKE +1 HARM. - YOU ARE SHAKEN. TAKE -1 ONGOING UNTIL YOU CAN
SPEND TIME CONNECTING WITH AN ANCHOR. ON A 7-9, THE MC CAN CHOOSE 1: -
YOU LOSE YOUR FOOTING - YOU LOSE YOUR GRIP ON WHATEVER YOU'RE HOLDING -
YOU LET SOMETHING OR SOMEONE YOU'RE ATTENDING TO FALL INTO DANGER, OR
DROP THE BALL ON AN OBLIGATION (ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF IT AFFECTS AN
ANCHOR) - YOU ARE DELAYED, TO DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF YOUR INJURY -
SOMETHING YOU WEREN'T PREPARED FOR HAPPENS ON A 6-, YOU TAKE THE HARM,
BUT THINGS DON'T GET WORSE.

> THIS MOVE WON'T ALWAYS OR EVEN OFTEN COME UP IN A SESSION, BUT
> SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET HURT, EVEN MAGES. IT CAN BE SMALL, LIKE GETTING
> THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF THEM (AN EXAMPLE OF 0 HARM) BUT IT CAN STILL
> AFFECT WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IN THE MOMENT.

WHEN YOU HAVE SOME TIME AND RELATIVE SAFETY AND YOU **PLAN A RITUAL** OF
MAGICAL POWER, DESCRIBE THE EFFECT YOU ARE TRYING FOR. THE MC MAY SAY
MORE INFORMATION OR CLARIY IS NEEDED BEFORE THE PLAN CAN BE FINALIZED.
ONCE THOSE NEEDS ARE MET, THE MC WILL SAY WHICH OF THESE ARE NEEDED TO
PERFORM THE RITUAL (IT MAY BE MORE THAN ONE): - EXTRA TIME - A CERTAIN
OBJECT - HELP FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE THEN, WRITE DOWN THE PLAN AND HOLD
1.

> "RITUAL" HERE IS A GENERAL TERM FOR MORE ADVANCED AND COMPLICATED
> MAGIC THAN IS USUALLY DONE ON THE FLY. THEY OFTEN INVOLVE MULTIPLE
> PARTICIPANTS, PRESCRIBED STEPS, AND ARE CAPABLE OF MORE THAN A SINGLE
> INDIVIDUAL'S UNPLANNED EFFORTS. A RITUAL MIGHT INCLUDE ALL THE CLASSIC
> TRAPPINGS, LIKE HOODED ROPES, DRIBBLY CANDLES, MAGIC CIRCLES, AND
> CHANTING, BUT IT MIGHT ALSO BE A ROCK CONCERT WITH A PARTICULAR
> SEQUENCE OF SONGS, OR AN ALL-NIGHT CODING SESSION, OR EVEN A
> DEMONSTRATIVE MARCH ON THE CAPITOL BUILDING. IF THERE IS A LOT OF
> TIME, AND THE MAGES ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING THEY COULD NEED, A PLAN
> MIGHT BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RITUAL, BUT
> QUITE OFTEN, THEY WILL BE SEPARATE EVENTS.

WHEN YOU HAVE TIME, RELATIVELY SAFETY, A PLACE OF POWER, AND ENOUGH
MAGES, AND YOU **BEGIN A RITUAL,** HAVE EACH MAGE INVOLVED DESCRIBE HOW
THEY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE RITUAL WITHIN THEIR PARADIGM. IF YOU HAVE
MET REQUIREMENTS SET OUT BY PLAN A RITUAL, YOU CAN SPEND A HOLD FROM IT,
AND TELL THE MC THE EFFECT THAT WILL OCCUR ON A SUCCESS, WITHIN THE
SCOPE OF THE PLANED EFFECT. OTHERWISE, THE MC DECIDES BASED ON EACH
MAGE'S CONTRIBUTIONS. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION EACH PARTICIPANT'S
OPPOSED, AND THE PROBABILITY OF RENDING MAGIC. THEN, ROLL +WITHIN. ON A
10+, THE RITUAL WORKS AS EXPECTED. ON A 7-9 THE MC WILL CHOOSE AT LEAST
ONE. - THE RITUAL TAKES LONGER THAN EXPECTED - YOU DRAW UNWANTED
ATTENTION - THE RITUAL CAUSES DISCORD - EVERYONE INVOLVED BACKLASHES -
THE RITUAL HAS GREATER THAN INTENDED EFFECTS.

> PERFORMING A RITUAL IS A COMPLICATED UNDERTAKING. EVEN IF YOU HAVE A
> THEORETICAL PLAN, WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE DETAILS, ESPECIALLY IF
> THERE ARE MULTIPLE MAGES, EVERYONE WILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY
> WILL BE, WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING, AND WHY IT MATTERS. A RITUAL WITH
> CROSSED PURPOSES, OR WORSE, A MAGE WHO DISCOVERS MIDWAY THROUGH THAT
> THEY DO NOT BELIEVE A TYPE OF MAGIC BEING EMPLOYED IS POSSIBLE, CAN BE
> A HUGE DISASTER, JUST AS HOW A SUCCESSFUL RITUAL CAN CREATE A HUGE
> EFFECT.
>
> PLANS CAN BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE, AND IN THE END, A RITUAL FOLLOWING A
> PLAN HAS ITS OUTCOME CHOSEN WHEN IT IS PERFORMED, NOT BACK WHEN IT WAS
> THOUGHT UP.
>
> IF A PLAN WAS MADE, BUT THE REQUIREMENTS WERE TOO HIGH, AND THEN A
> RITUAL TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING IS ATTEMPTED ANYWAY, THIS IS JUST
> LIKE IMPROVISING A RITUAL, AND THE OUTCOME REALLY IS DEFINED ONLY BY
> WHAT EACH CONSTITUENT MAGE IS DOING. HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE TALKED IT
> THROUGH WELL ENOUGH TO HAVE THE SAME GOALS AND A WAY OF GETTING THERE.

WHEN YOU **LOSE AN ANCHOR**, ROLL +ANCHORS LEFT. ON A 10+, IT MAY TAKE
SOME TIME, BUT YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS. ON A 7-9, CHOOSE 1: - ANOTHER
ANCHOR GETS PUT IN DANGER - YOU DO SOMETHING YOU WILL REGRET. THE MC
TELLS YOU WHAT. NOTE: THIS MEANS IT DOES NOT CAUSE ANOTHER ANCHOR TO GET
PUT IN DANGER - YOU BACKLASH ON A MISS: LOSE ANOTHER ANCHOR. THE MC WILL
TELL YOU WHICH ONE AND HOW.

> LOSING AN ANCHOR CAN HURT. ANY TIME A CONNECTION IS BROKEN, EVEN UNDER
> AMICABLE TERMS, IT CAN BE A DETACTCHING FEELING, LEAVING YOU ADRIFT.
> FOR A MAGE, CAPABLE OF WALKING INTO OTHER WORLDS ENTIRELY, OR REACHING
> LEVELS OF ENLIGHTENMENT IN THIS ONE NEARLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO
> ONLOOKERS, IT CAN BE PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS. EVEN IF THE MAGE IS HAPPY
> TO SEE THE ANCHOR GO, IT WILL BE DESTABILIZING. IF THEY'RE NOT
> CAREFUL, THE MAGE MIGHT START TO SPIRAL.

AT THE **END OF SESSION**: NOTE ANY EFFECTS THAT LASTED "UNTIL END OF
SESSION," BUT SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT. THEN, ASK YOURSELVES THESE
QUESTIONS AS A GROUP. FOR EVERY ONE YOU ANSWER "YES" TO, EVERYONE MARKS
EXPERIENCE. - DID YOU SHOW THE LENGTHS YOU WERE WILLING TO GO TO IN
ORDER TO PROTECT AN ANCHOR? - DID YOU UNCOVER A SECRET? - DID YOU LEARN
SOMETHING THAT PUTS YOUR PARADIGMS IN PERSPECTIVE, OR CAUSED YOU TO
QUESTION THEM? - DID YOU EXPOSE THE DEPTHS OF YOUR HUMANITY, TO YOURSELF
OR TO SOMEONE ELSE? - DID YOU WITNESS LOSS, SELFISHNESS, OR PAIN BORN OF
MAGIC?

> THIS MOVE WRAPS UP THE SESSION, AND REWARDS YOU FOR DELVING INTO
> CERTAIN PARTS OF THE GAME. AFTER FINISHING IT, PACK UP YOUR CHARACTER
> SHEETS. GO AHEAD AND KEEP THINKING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT, AND
> SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE ADVANCEMENTS TO PICK, BUT THE GAME IS DONE, FOR
> NOW.

WHEN YOUR **HARM REACHES CODE N**, ROLL +WITHIN. ON A 10+ YOU STABILIZE,
AND WILL NEED MEDICAL CARE, BUT YOU SHOULD LIVE. ON A 7-9, SOME SERIOUS
MAGIC IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO HELP YOU SURVIVE, PLUS THE MEDICAL CARE.
ON A 6-, YOU'RE ABOUT TO BITE THE DUST. MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR PARADIGM.
IF YOU HAVE TWO OR LESS ANCHORS, YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF REMOVING AN
ANCHOR IN ORDER TO STABILIZE. DESCRIBE HOW YOU SPIRITUALLY CUT YOURSELF
OFF FROM THE ANCHOR, INFUSING YOURSELF WITH MAGIC IN ORDER TO HEAL, BUT
TAKING A HUGE STEP AWAY FROM REALITY IN DOING SO.

> EVERYTHING DIES EVENTUALLY. THAT INCLUDES MAGES. WHEN YOU DIE, YOU GET
> ONE FINAL SCENE TO IMPART WISDOM ON YOUR FRIENDS, OR JUST UNLEASH AN
> UNHOLY BLAST OF RENDING MAGIC AT THE ONE WHO KILLED YOU. DEATH IS NOT
> ALWAYS THE END, ESPECIALLY FOR MAGES. BUT IT IS THE END FOR NOW.

WHEN **ONE OF YOUR ANCHORS IS PUT IN DANGER**, MARK EXPERIENCE AND
EITHER GO AND HANDLE IT, OR LOSE THEM AS AN ANCHOR.

> THE THING ABOUT HAVING ANCHORS THAT YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT IS THAT
> SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THEM, TO YOURSELF AS
> MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE. "IN DANGER" MEANS OF NO LONGER BEING YOUR
> ANCHOR, NOT NECESSARILY A TRUE THREAT TO THEIR BEING. AND SOMETIMES,
> YOU REALIZE THAT ACTUALLY, YOU DON'T CARE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THIS,
> AND THAT ISN'T A REALIZATION YOU CAN GO BACK ON.

WHEN YOU **DESCRIBE A MAGICAL EFFECT WITHIN YOUR PARADIGM BUT BEYOND
YOUR NORMAL ABILITIES**, THE MC MAY TELL YOU A RESOURCE YOU COULD
CONSUME TO ACHIEVE THE EFFECT.

> EVEN MAGES HAVE THEIR LIMITS. ARCHIMEDES SUPPOSEDLY SAID, "GIVE ME THE

> PLACE, AND A LONG ENOUGH LEVER. WHEN A MAGE THINKS ABOUT WHAT THEY

> COME UP WITH SOMETHING. IT MIGHT NOT BE EASILY ACHIEVABLE AND THEY
> MIGHT NOT WANT TO GIVE IT UP, BUT THE POSSIBILITY IS THERE.

CHANGING FLAGS
--------------

YOU'LL SET UP YOUR FLAGS DURING THE FIRST SESSION. FLAGS ARE SPECIAL
SORTS OF MOVES, MADE BY THE PLAYERS, THAT ENCOURAGE CERTAIN TYPES OF
INTERACTION WITH THEIR MAGE. YOU CAN THINK OF A FLAG AS A MOVE IN THE
FORMAT OF "WHEN YOU **INTERACT IN A CERTAIN WAY WITH MY MAGE**, MARK
EXPERIENCE." ONCE A FLAG HAS BEEN HIT (IE THE MOVE ABOVE HAS BEEN
TRIGGERED), IT MAY OR MAY NOT STILL BE INTERESTING FOR THE PLAYER.
ADDITIONALLY, ONCE YOUR MAGE HAS HIT SOMEONE'S FLAG, YOU CAN NOT DO SO
AGAIN UNTIL THEY CHANGE IT. EVERY TIME A FLAG IS HIT, AND AT THE
BEGINNING OF A SESSION IF A FLAG HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN HIT, THAT PLAYER
MAY CHANGE THE FLAG TO BETTER REFLECT HOW THEY WANT THE OTHER PLAYERS'
MAGES TO INTERACT WITH THEIR MAGE.

IMPROVEMENT
-----------

AMONG THE MANY IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOUR PLAYBOOK, YOU MAY
SEE OPTIONS SUCH AS GAIN ANOTHER \[PLAYBOOK\] MOVE, GAIN A MOVE FROM
ANOTHER PLAYBOOK, OR GAIN AN ADVANCED \[PLAYBOOK\] MOVE. MOVES FROM YOUR
PLAYBOOK ARE LISTED ALONG WITH THE MOVES YOU PICKED FROM WHEN CREATING
THAT CHARACTER. CHOOSE AN ADDITIONAL ONE, AND YOU NOW HAVE ACCESS TO IT.
WHEN YOU GAIN A MOVE FROM ANOTHER PLAYBOOK, TRY TO CHOOSE ONE THAT
SOMEONE ELSE ISN'T PLAYING, OR AT LEAST TALK WITH THE PLAYER USING THAT
PLAYBOOK. THE PLAYBOOK MOVES ARE PART OF WHAT MAKE CHARACTERS FEEL
UNIQUE, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THAT. WHEN YOU GAIN AN ADVANCED
PLAYBOOK MOVE, CHOOSE FROM THE ONES LISTED IN THIS BOOK FOR YOUR
PLAYBOOK. THESE MOVES WILL RADICALLY ALTER THE GAME AND STORY, YOUR
WHOLE TABLE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR WHAT THAT MEANS.

\newpage

THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES
========================

THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES, OR MC, FACILITATES CONVERSATION AND PLAY. THIS
IS THE PLAYER WHOSE JOB IT IS TO MAKE THE MOVES THAT KEEP THE
CONVERSATION FLOWING, IN SOME GAMES THIS ROLE WOULD BE CALLED THE GM.
IT'S HARD TO ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING INTERESTING TO SAY UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES, SO THE RULES THAT THE MC HAS TO FOLLOW HELP MAKE SURE
THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING ENTERTAINING. THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER WILL HELP
YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY WHEN THE WHOLE TABLE LOOKS AT YOU TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS NEXT. THE NEXT SECTIONS WILL PROVIDE THE RULES AND STRUCTURE FOR
YOU TO FOLLOW. THESE AREN'T SUGGESTIONS, THESE ARE YOUR SET OF RULES AS
THE MC PLAYER, AND FOLLOWING THEM IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE GAME WORKING
SMOOTHLY.

AGENDA
------

THE AGENDA IS YOUR MOST ABSTRACT, HIGHEST ORDER, SET OF RULES. THESE ARE
YOUR OBJECTIVES DURING THE GAME. IF YOU SUCCEED AT ALL OF THESE AGENDAS
DURING A GIVEN SESSION, YOU WILL FIND THAT THE STORY NATURALLY FOLLOWS.

**PROVIDE THE CHARACTERS WITH STRIFE BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT.**

MAGES DO NOT LEAD BORING LIVES. WHEN THEY TALK WITH FRIENDS AND ALLIES,
THEY HAVE DEEP, WEIGHTY CONVERSATIONS THAT RESHAPE VIEWS OF REALITY, OR
PREPARE TO RESHAPE ACTUAL REALITY. GIVE THEM SCENES WHERE THEIR BELIEFS
ARE CHALLENGED OR THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH. WHEN THEY VENTURE
OUT TO THWART THE PLANS OF INSIDIOUS FORCES, THE BALANCE CAN SWING ON
THEIR WITS AND ON THE WEIGHT OF THEIR CONVICTIONS. GIVE THEM SCENES
WHERE THE DANGER IS REAL AND IMMEDIATE. WHEN THEY SEEK A MOMENT'S
RESPITE, THEY FORGE CONNECTIONS THAT CAN GUIDE THEM LIKE STARLIGHT, IF
THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY TURNED AWAY. GIVE THEM SCENES WHERE THEY CAN SHOW
THAT THEY CARE.

**PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.**

THIS MEANS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A STORY PLANNED OUT THAT YOU'RE RUNNING
THE PLAYERS THROUGH. IT MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME
INKLINGS OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, QUITE OFTEN YOU'LL FIND OUT
YOU'RE WRONG, BECAUSE THE PLAYERS COME UP WITH AN IDEA THAT JUST FITS,
OR A MOVE FORCES YOUR HAND. IT MAY SEEM ODD AT FIRST IF YOU'RE USED TO A
MORE PREPARATION-HEAVY STYLE OF RUNNING A GAME, BUT TRUST US, THE FUN
YOU HAVE FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT RIGHT ALONG WITH THE PLAYERS IS
WORTH IT.

**ASK WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.**

CONSENSUS IS A GAME ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE EVERYTHING HUMANS CAN BE, WANT
TO BE, STRIVE TO BE. BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW THESE PEOPLE STILL CAN
FAIL, WHETHER BY NOT BEING TRUE ENOUGH TO THEMSELVES OR BY GOING TOO
FAR. AS YOU ASK LEADING QUESTIONS, MAKE MOVES, AND WRITE FORCES, FOCUS
ON MAKING YOURSELF AND THE OTHER PLAYERS THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF
HUMANITY, THEIRSELVES' AND OTHERS'. IN THIS GAME, A SCENE ABOUT A
CHARACTER DROWNING THEIR SORROWS IN A BAR CAN BE JUST AS IMPORTANT, IF
NOT MORESO, AS A KNOCK-DOWN DRAG-OUT FIGHT. SORROWS MAKE US HUMAN, WHILE
ANY BEAST CAN DO BATTLE.

**MAKE THE CONSENSUS COME TO LIFE.**

YOUR JOB IS TO PLAY THE WORLD AND THE OTHER PEOPLE IN IT AS IF THEY WERE
REAL. NO PERSON EXISTS JUST TO GIVE THE CHARACTERS SOME INFORMATION AND
THEN BE IGNORED, THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE CHARACTERS MET
SOMEONE AND DEMANDED SOMETHING FROM THEM, AND THEN NEEDED THEIR HELP
LATER. IN THIS WAY, YOU MAKE THE WORLD FEEL REAL, LIKE A LIVING,
BREATHING WORLD, ONE THAT IS EXCITING TO EXPLORE.

ALWAYS SAY
----------

WHEN THE OTHER PLAYERS LOOK TO YOU TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, YOU HAVE TO SAY
SOMETHING. MAKE SURE THE THINGS YOU SAY FOLLOW THESE RULES.

**WHAT THE PRINCIPLES DEMAND**

YOUR PRINCIPLES, BELOW, ADDRESS HOW YOU SPEAK TO THE TABLE, AND WHAT YOU
SAY. DON'T CONTRADICT ANY OF YOUR PRINCIPLES WHEN YOU ADDRESS THE TABLE.

**WHAT THE RULES DEMAND**

THIS IS BOTH YOUR RULES DETAILED HERE, AND THE REST OF THE RULES OF
PLAY, SUCH AS THE BASIC MOVES, AND THE PLAYBOOK MOVES. SOMETIMES THESE
WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO SAY DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF A ROLL.

**WHAT YOUR PREP DEMANDS**

WHEN WE SAID ABOVE THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE ANY KIND OF PREPARATION, WE WERE
STRETCHING THE TRUTH A LITTLE. THE GAME WILL TELL YOU TO MAKE FORCES
AFTER THE FIRST SESSION, AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK TO THESE WHEN YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, THEY WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO SAY.

**WHAT HONESTY DEMANDS**

YOUR JOB ISN'T TO LIE TO THE PLAYERS, OR TRICK THEM, OR MAKE THEM GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. SOME GAMES ARE ABOUT THAT, THIS ONE ISN'T. SO WHEN
A PLAYER ASKS A QUESTION, ANSWER IT HONESTLY, AND BE GENEROUS WITH THE
TRUTH. IF THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER ENTERS A ROOM, YOU SHOULD DESCRIBE IT,
SET THE SCENE, AND DON'T LEAVE OUT IMPORTANT DETAILS WAITING FOR THEM TO
ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION.

THE PRINCIPLES
--------------

**RIDDLE THE WORLD WITH HIDDEN MAGIC, UNEXPECTED CONNECTIONS, AND
UNRECOGNIZED POTENTIAL**

SAVE UP THOSE IMAGES THAT SPEAK TO YOU FROM YOUR FAVORITE MEDIA ABOUT
MAGIC. DON'T JUST DESCRIBE A BOOKSTORE, TALK ABOUT THE DUST LAYING THICK
ON A STACK OF BOOKS IN THE BACK, TALK ABOUT A GHOSTLY LIGHT SHINING
THROUGH THE MOTES OF DUST LIKE A SUNBEAM NORMALLY WOULD. MAKE THE WORLD
FEEL LIKE THERE'S MAGIC IN IT, BUT ALSO THAT IT'S HIDDEN, BURIED, OR
UNSEEN.

**CREATE EPHEMERA**

DURING THE GAME THINGS WILL COME UP THAT NEED A VISUAL, TACTILE, OR
WRITTEN AID. DRAW MAPS OF THE CITIES, WRITE THE MAGES LETTERS FROM THEIR
MENTORS ON AGING PARCHMENT, WRITE DOWN THE STEPS OF A RITUAL TO BE
INCLUDED IN A GRIMOIRE MANY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. PLAY MUSIC OR AMBIENT
SOUND IF IT FITS THE MOOD. SKETCH CHARACTERS, MAKE PROPS, BRING THE
MAGIC TO OUR WORLD JUST A LITTLE BIT.

**USE CHARACTER NAMES**

WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE PLAYERS, MAKE SURE TO SPEAK AT THE CHARACTER
THEY'RE PLAYING, USE THEIR MAGE'S NAME WHEN YOU ASK THEM LEADING
QUESTIONS, OR WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHAT THEY DO NEXT. SPEAK IN FIRST PERSON
AS THE CHARACTERS YOU PLAY, ENGAGE THE MAGES IN CONVERSATION.

**STAY IN THE NARRATIVE**

YOU HAVE A LOT OF AGENDAS, PRINCIPLES, AND MOVES, AND THEY'RE GREAT.
THEY'RE WONDERFUL. THEY'RE YOUR RULES. BUT JUST LIKE A BASEBALL GAME
WOULD BE BORING IF THE PITCHER STOOD STILL AND YELLED "FASTBALL," WHILE
THE BATTER ALSO STOOD STILL AND YELLED "SINGLE," INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY
PLAYING THE GAME, YOU ALSO SHOULDN'T JUST SAY WHAT MOVE YOU'RE MAKING
WHEN THE PLAYERS LOOK TO YOU, YOU SHOULD WEAVE THAT MOVE INTO THE
NARRATIVE, TELL THEM WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, WHAT THEIR CHARACTERS CAN SENSE
ABOUT IT, TELL THEM WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE FICTIONAL WORLD.

**MAKE EVERYONE VULNERABLE**

THIS PRINCIPLE HAS A FEW LAYERS OF MEANING. FIRST, REMEMBER THAT NONE OF
THE CHARACTERS THAT YOU MAKE UP TO INTERACT WITH THE MAGES, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THEM, IS INVINCIBLE. CHARACTERS CAN GET HURT,
CAPTURED, OR WORSE, AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID TO LET THAT HAPPEN TO
EVEN YOUR FAVORITE CHARACTER, IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FICTION.
SECOND, REMEMBER THAT EVERYONE HAS WEAKNESSES, AND IRRATIONAL LIKE OR
DISLIKE OF CERTAIN THINGS. EVEN IF THEY PUT ON A TOUGH FACE, LET YOUR
CHARACTERS BE VULNERABLE. THIRD, FOLLOWING THAT, LET YOUR CHARACTERS
SHOW EMOTION, LET THEM CONNECT WITH THE MAGES AND SHARE THOSE MOMENTS OF
VULNERABILITY.

**GIVE EVERYONE NAMES AND DESIRES**

ALL OF YOUR CHARACTERS SHOULD HAVE NAMES, LIVES, AND MOTIVATIONS.
THERE'S NO FACELESS BARTENDER, NO SHOPKEEP WHO ONLY EXISTS TO BUY AND
SELL FROM. EVERYONE IN YOUR WORLD SHOULD FEEL REAL, AND THREE
DIMENSIONAL. WHEN YOU MAKE CHARACTERS FOR THE MAGES TO INTERACT WITH,
GIVE THEM A GOAL, WHATEVER THEY'RE STRIVING TOWARDS. THIS MAY BE THE
SAME AS THEIR FORCES GOAL (SEE THE FORCES CHAPTER) BUT MOST LIKELY IT'S
SMALLER AND MORE PERSONAL. WHENEVER YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THAT CHARACTER
WOULD ACT OR REACT, REFER BACK TO THEIR GOAL.

**DEMAND EVOCATIVE ANSWERS, THEN FOLLOW THROUGH**

SOMETIMES YOU'RE GOING TO BE ASKING LEADING, PROVOCATIVE, AND PERSONAL
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MAGES. YOU CAN EVEN DO SO WITH QUESTIONS THAT ASSERT
A TRUTH IN THE QUESTION ITSELF, LIKE ASKING A MAGE WHO THEY SCREWED OVER
IN THE PAST. THIS IS PART OF HOW YOU BUILD THE WORLD COLLABORATIVELY
WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS. DON'T LET THEM OFF THE HOOK WITH SIMPLE, SAFE
ANSWERS, PRESS FOR MORE, GET THEM INTO THE DETAILS. AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT
THAT, MAKE SURE TO (AS THEY SAY IN IMPROV) "YES, AND" THEIR ANSWER AND
BUILD ON IT IN FUN AND INTERESTING WAYS.

**SOMETIMES, GIVE THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR**

OFTEN TIMES, BECAUSE MAGES LIVES AREN'T BORING, THERE'S CHALLENGES AND
HURDLES IN THE WAY OF GETTING WHAT THEY WANT. BUT IF EVERY LITTLE STEP
OF THE WAY HAS A HURDLE, SUDDENLY NO ONE CAN MOVE. SOMETIMES YOU SHOULD
GIVE CHARACTERS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEIR
LIVES BECOME PREDICTABLE (AND THEREFORE BORING). OTHER TIMES, YOU SHOULD
ALSO GIVE THEM *EXACTLY* WHAT THEY ASK FOR, AND HAVE THEM REALIZE WHY
IT'S A MONKEY'S PAW JUST A LITTLE TOO LATE.

**ROOT FOR THE MAGES**

YOU AND THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE ON THE SAME TEAM, SO IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
TO ROOT FOR THE MAGES. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU WANT THEIR LIVES TO BE EASY
(BORING), BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO SEE THEM OVERCOME THEIR STRUGGLES, TALK
ABOUT THINGS THAT MATTER TO THEM, AND DO COOL THINGS. CONVERSELY, IT'S
OKAY FOR THE MAGES TO FAIL, AND IF IT HAPPENS YOU SHOULD LET IT HAPPEN
AND NOT TRY TO SAVE THEM, BECAUSE YOU'RE ROOTING FOR THEM, NOT TRYING TO
PLAY FOR THEM. CHEER THEM ON WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING GREAT, AND WINCE AND
COVER YOUR EYES WHEN THEY MAKE MISTAKES, JUST LIKE YOU MIGHT FOR YOUR
FAVORITE CHARACTERS ON A TV SHOW.

**THINK ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE**

SOMETIMES SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN IN A SCENE THAT HAS A FAR-REACHING
EFFECT, OUTSIDE OF JUST THE LIMITED SCENE THAT'S CURRENTLY ON SCREEN.
THINK ABOUT HOW BIG THINGS CAN AFFECT YOUR FORCES, EVEN THE ONES WHO
AREN'T PRESENT AT THE MOMENT. ALSO, SOMETIMES A MAGE WILL ROLL A 6-, OR
THE TABLE WILL LOOK TO YOU TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, AND NONE OF YOUR MOVES
MAKE SENSE TO HAVE HAPPEN RIGHT THEN IN THAT SCENE. MAKE A MOVE
OFF-SCREEN, DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE PLAYERS, AND WHAT, IF
ANYTHING, THEIR CHARACTERS NOTICE ABOUT IT.

**TAKE SOME DECISIONS OUT OF YOUR OWN HANDS**

SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER, OR YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OUTCOME OF SOMETHING. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO PASS THE
BUCK OCCASIONALLY, BY DOING ONE OF A FEW THINGS. YOU CAN TURN THE
QUESTION BACK ON ONE OF THE PLAYERS. "I DON'T KNOW VINCE, DO YOU HAVE A
SECRET STASH OF HIGHLY DANGEROUS ALCHEMICAL COMPONENTS IN YOUR
APARTMENT?" YOU CAN LOOK TO THE OUTCOME OF A MOVE, IF ONE APPLIES. YOU
CAN LOOK TO THE RELEVANT CHARACTER'S GOAL, OR YOU CAN LOOK TO THE
RELEVANT FORCE'S STATUS TRACK. THOSE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE THE DECISION
MADE FOR YOU.

**DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE OBVIOUS**

IT CAN BE SO EASY TO GET WRAPPED UP IN TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING COOL
AND UNIQUE, AND SOMETIMES THAT'S FUN, BUT THIS GAME WORKS VERY WELL IF
YOU SOMETIMES JUST DO OR SAY THE OBVIOUS THING. TROPES ARE TROPES FOR A
REASON, AND ACTIONS HAVE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES, SO WHEN A MAGE IS TRYING
TO **OUTWIT, OUTPACE, OR OUTFOX** A PURSUER BY CLIMBING UP A TALL
BUILDING, AND THEY ROLL A 6-, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE OBVIOUS
THING HAPPEN. THEY FALL FLAT ON THEIR BACK AND HURT THEMSELVES (DEAL
DAMAGE).

BEING OBVIOUS CAN LET THE PLAYERS FEEL GOOD THAT THEY PREDICTED
SOMETHING. IT'S BORING IF THAT HAPPENS TOO OFTEN, BUT GETTING IT RIGHT
FROM TIME TO TIME CAN BE REWARDING AND SATISFYING. PLUS, IF EVERYONE
KNOWS WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY COMING UP AND SEEMS INTO IT, THEN YOU ALREADY
KNOW THAT IF YOU MAKE IT HAPPEN, THE PLAYERS WILL LIKE IT.

ADDITIONALLY, SINCE EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT, SOMETIMES WHAT IS OBVIOUS TO
YOU ISN'T AT ALL OBVIOUS TO THE OTHER PLAYERS. IN OUR EXPERIENCE, YOU
CAN JUST KEEP SAYING WHAT'S OBVIOUS, AND THE PLAYERS WILL KEEP THINKING
THE STORY IS FULL OF CREATIVE TWISTS AND TURNS.

YOUR MOVES
----------

YOUR MOVES BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER MOVES IN THE GAME. WHILE MOST
MOVES TRIGGER WHEN A CHARACTER NOT CONTROLLED BY YOU TAKES AN ACTION IN
THE FICTION, YOUR MOVES ARE A SET OF OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN THE
OTHERS AT THE TABLE LOOK TO YOU. THE MOVE GIVES YOU THE GENERAL
FRAMEWORK OF WHAT HAPPENS, AND THEN IT'S UP TO YOU TO DESCRIBE THE
ACTUAL EVENTS IN THE NARRATIVE. EVERYONE AT THE TABLE LOOKING AT YOU
WILL USUALLY HAPPEN WHEN NOTHING ELSE IS HAPPENING, WHEN ONE OF THEIR
MOVES PROMPTS A RESPONSE OR INTERPRETATION FROM YOU, OR WHEN THEY ARE
ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT THE WORLD. YOU WILL PRIVATELY PICK A MOVE, COME
UP WITH HOW IT WORKS IN, AND THEN MAKE IT REAL.

YOUR MOVES ARE SHORT PHRASES LIKE "MAKE THEM CONJURE OR BUY" OR
"IMPRISON SOMEONE." OTHER THAN IN-GAME CONCEPTS LIKE DISCORD, THEY DON'T
CARRY SPECIAL MEANING. "RAISE THE STAKES" REALLY DOES LITERALLY MEAN DO
THAT. MOVES MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW FROM THE FICTION, AND LIKELY WILL NOT
LOOK THE SAME TWICE. IN ONE SCENE, YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO RAISE THE STAKES
BY HAVING A TENSE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHICH BEDROOM A GUEST WILL STAY IN
SUDDENLY BECOME ABOUT WHETHER TO REMAIN ROOMMATES AT ALL. IN ANOTHER,
RAISING THE STAKES MIGHT BE KNIVES COMING OUT AT A FISTFIGHT. WHATEVER
HAPPENS, DESCRIBE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FICTION, NOT THE GAME RULES.
IT SHOULDN'T ACTUALLY MATTER TO THE OTHER PLAYERS THAT YOU ARE USING
INVENT A PREDICAMENT FOR SOMEONE. WHAT MATTERS IS THAT A LOOKOUT
SAUNTERS INTO THE ALLEY FOR A SMOKE BREAK JUST AS THEY'RE ABOUT TO STEP
THROUGH THEIR DIMENSIONAL DOOR.

WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVE, IT CAN BE BROADLY CATEGORIZED AS "HARD" OR "SOFT".
HARD MOVES HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE IMMEDIATE AND IRREVOCABLE. THEY
SHOULD INSPIRE FURTHER ACTION, BUT WILL NOT SIMPLY BE UNDONE OR BLOCKED.
A SECRET COMING OUT, AN ITEM BREAKING, AN INJURY. SOFT MOVES ADVANCE THE
ACTION, IN PARTICULAR BY SETTING UP HARD MOVES THAT WILL COME TO PASS IF
THE MAGES DON'T INTERCEDE. SOMEONE COMING HOME BUT NOT YET SEEING A MAGE
IN A COMPROMISING POSITION COULD BE A SOFT MOVE, AND IF THE MAGE DOESN'T
WORK TO HIDE OR EXPLAIN THINGS, THEN SOON THE SECRET WILL COME OUT, AS A
HARD MOVE. MOST MOVES CAN BE HARD OR SOFT, DEPENDING ON THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT SOME ARE EASIER TO USE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. WE HAVE
ARRANGED THEM FROM GENERALLY SOFTER TO GENERALLY HARDER, BUT THAT'S JUST
FOR CONVENIENCE, AND FOR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION.

WHEN YOU NEED TO CHOOSE A MOVE, CHOOSE ONE THAT CAN FOLLOW LOGICALLY
FROM THE GAME'S FICTION. IT MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY ONE, BUT IT SHOULD BE
PLAUSIBLE. REMEMBER IT'S OK TO BE OBVIOUS, SO IF SOMETHING FROM A MOMENT
AGO COULD DEMAND A RESPONSE, THEN FIND A MOVE THAT FITS IT AND SAY THAT.
HOWEVER, ALSO REMEMBER YOUR PRINCIPLE TO THINK ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE.
THINGS YOU HAVE SET UP IN THE PAST CAN SUDDENLY MAKE AN APPEARANCE AND
STILL BE FOLLOWING FROM THE FICTION.

MOST OF THE TIME, YOU'LL BE MAKING SOFT MOVES. THESE LET THE ACTION KEEP
ADVANCING, BUT KEEP GIVING THE OTHER PLAYERS THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO
THINGS. REMEMBER THAT SOFT MOVES SHOULD SUGGEST HARD MOVES THAT COULD
OCCUR IF NOTHING HAPPENS. IT CAN EVEN BE AS DIRECT AS "WITH A CRACK, THE
BRANCH BREAKS. YOU'RE RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT! WHAT WILL YOU DO?" AND IF
THEY SAY "I KEEP STANDING THERE", THEN GO AHEAD AND USE A HARD MOVE TO
DEAL DAMAGE.

YOU ARE EMPOWERED TO MAKE A HARD MOVE WHEN THEY HAND YOU A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY ON A SILVER PLATTER. THIS CAN BE BECAUSE THE CHARACTER
EXPLICITLY IGNORES A SOFT MOVE THAT WAS ALREADY IN PLAY. IT CAN ALSO BE
BECAUSE A CHARACTER TRIES SOMETHING THAT WILL CLEARLY GO POORLY FOR
THEM, AND YOU RESPOND WITH THE SOFT MOVE THAT IS TELL THEM THE POSSIBLE
CONSEQUENCES AND ASK, AND THEY FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT ANYWAY. IF
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SETTING UP, THROUGH ONE OR MORE SOFT MOVES,
COMES TO PASS, THAT'S A TIME TO MAKE A HARD MOVE. THIS WON'T BE A
SURPRISE BECAUSE OF THE PRINCIPLE TO BE GENEROUS WITH THE TRUTH, BUT CAN
REPRESENT THE MAGES RUNNING OUT OF TIME, OR THE DRAMATIC IRONY OF THE
MAGES NOT NOTICING SOMETHING THAT THE PLAYERS ARE AWARE OF. IN ADDITION,
IF SOMEONE ROLLS A 6-, YOU MAKE A HARD MOVE. IT MAY BE MOSTLY DICTATED
BY A "ON A 6-" CLAUSE IN THE PLAYER'S MOVE IF PRESENT, BUT MOST OF THE
TIME YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, AND HAVE TO FOLLOW THE FICTION TO COME UP WITH
AN OUTCOME.

ONE VERY FLEXIBLE SOFT MOVE IS SET UP A FUTURE PROBLEM, WHICH CAN
STRETCH TO ANYTHING FROM THE EXTREME SHORT TERM, LIKE "THE CAR SWERVES
AND IS COMING RIGHT AT YOU!" TO A MORE FAR-OFF "AS YOU SHAKE THE DEAN'S
HAND, YOU SEE A CAMERA FLASH. THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE IN THE PAPERS
TOMORROW..."

ANOTHER FLEXIBLE MOVE IS DECLARE SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED ELSEWHERE.
"SOMETHING BAD" IS QUITE BROAD, AND THE THING ABOUT MAGES IS THAT
TODAY'S "ELSEWHERE" IS OFTEN TOMORROW'S "HERE."

AFTER YOU MAKE A MOVE, ALWAYS TURN IT BACK TO THE OTHER PLAYERS. ASK
THEM, "WHAT DO YOU DO?"

### SOFTER MOVES

**TELL THEM THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND ASK**

THIS IS A HANDY MOVE TO USE FOR WHEN A MAGE GETS STUCK WITH A HARD
CHOICE. IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR TIMES WHEN THEY ASK IF IT'S POSSIBLE FOR
THEIR CHARACTER TO DO SOMETHING. ALSO FOR TIMES WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING
LIKE "I JUMP OUT OF THE AIRPLANE." TELL THEM THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES
OF GETTING WHAT THEY WANT, AND ASK "DO YOU DO IT?" FOR EXAMPLE:

*"SO PIPER, YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVE THAT YOU'RE SOMEONE THESE SPIRITS
SHOULD LISTEN TO. YOU CAN DO IT, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING YOUR
PEOPLE IN LINE AND SNAP AT ONE OF THEM. THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL HURT. WHAT
DO YOU DO?"*

**OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY, WITH OR WITHOUT A COST**

ANOTHER VERY HANDY MOVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE TABLE STALLS A LITTLE BIT.
YOU CAN USE THIS FOR ANYTHING FROM TELLING THE MAGES ABOUT A GREAT SALE
ON HERBS, TO LETTING THEM EAVESDROP ON SOMEONE IMPORTANT. FOR EXAMPLE:

*"YES, YOU CAN GET CLOSER AND HEAR EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, BUT IF
YOU WANT TO STAY HIDDEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP DIRECTLY ON A PILE
OF RARE BOOKS. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**SET UP A FUTURE PROBLEM**

ONE OF YOUR MOST VERSATILE MOVES, THIS IS ONE OF YOUR BEST WAYS TO SET
UP A FUTURE HARD MOVE. IN PARTICULAR THIS SHOULD GIVE THE MAGES
INFORMATION WHICH, IF THEY DON'T ACT ON, WILL RESULT IN A HARD MOVE.
THIS COULD BE FAR IN THE FUTURE, FOR EXAMPLE:

*"YOU GET THE RITUAL OFF IN TIME, AND AS THE FINAL ENERGY FLASHES OUT
FROM YOUR CIRCLE, YOU REALIZE THAT SOME OF IT GOT SIPHONED OFF INTO A
BATTERY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN. SOMEONE MUST BE TRYING TO POWER SOME
REALLY BIG MAGIC. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

THIS CAN ALSO BE VERY NEAR IN THE FUTURE, EVEN JUST A MOMENT IN THE
FUTURE. FOR EXAMPLE:

*"THEY ACTIVATE A RUNIC CIRCLE DRAWN ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF THEM, AND
YOU SEE AN ELECTRICAL WIRE BREAK OFF THE TELEPHONE POLE, IT'S HEADED
STRAIGHT FOR PIPER. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**GIVE THEM AN ANSWER THEY WON'T LIKE**

SOMETIMES MAGES ARE TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION, OR ASK A QUESTION
ABOUT THE WORLD. THIS MOVE IS WHERE YOU CAN LET THEM SUCCEED ON
GATHERING THAT INFORMATION, OR LET THEM NOTICE THE THING ABOUT THE WORLD
THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT, BUT WHEN THEY DO THEY FIND OUT IT'S NOT WHAT THEY
WERE HOPING FOR. FOR EXAMPLE:

*"YOUR RESEARCH ON THE ANCIENT FAERIES IS ACTUALLY QUITE FRUITFUL, YOU
LEARN THAT THEY WERE MUCH MORE POWERFUL, WELL RESPECTED, AND GIVEN A
WIDE BERTH IF POSSIBLE. THEY DON'T SHARE THE MODERN FAERIES WEAKNESS TO
IRON, MUSIC, OR FIRE. AND WORST OF ALL, YOU LEARN THAT THEY FEED OFF
MORTAL MAGIC. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**PIT THEIR DESIRES AGAINST EACH OTHER**

THIS CAN MEAN EITHER PITTING ONE MAGE'S DESIRE AGAINST ANOTHER'S, OR IT
CAN MEAN MAKING A SINGLE MAGE'S DESIRES CONFLICT IN THAT MOMENT. FOR
EXAMPLE:

*"THE ICE PRINCESS IS WILLING TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO RESCUE YOUR
FRIEND, A SCEPTER MADE OF PURE UNMELTING ICE, BUT IF SHE DOES SO, SHE
WARNS THAT SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD OFF THE GHOSTS THAT HAVE BEEN
THREATENING YOU ANY MORE. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**DEMAND UPKEEP FROM AN ANCHOR**

ANCHORS ARE REAL PEOPLE, OR PLACES, OR THINGS THAT NEED ATTENTION PAID
TO THEM. THAT'S HOW THEY GROUND THE MAGE. SO A WINDOW BEING BROKEN IN
YOUR APARTMENT, OR A CALL FROM YOUR MOTHER ASKING YOU TO STOP BY FOR A
FAMILY PARTY SINCE SHE HASN'T SEEN YOU IN FOREVER. THESE ARE
PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO SET UP LATER SCENES FOCUSING ON THAT ANCHOR,
BECAUSE THE MAGE EITHER NEEDS TO GO UPKEEP THAT RELATIONSHIP, OR RISK
LOSING THEIR TETHER TO REALITY.

*"YOU FINISH READING THAT TOME AND THE POSSIBILITIES ARE RUNNING THROUGH
YOUR HEAD, THERE'S SO MUCH YOU CAN DO NOW THAT YOU NEVER COULD BEFORE.
BUT BEFORE YOU GET A CHANCE TO TEST ANY OF IT, YOUR PHONE RINGS. IT'S
YOUR AUNT CALLING TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU PROMISED TO MOW THE LAWN
YESTERDAY, AND IT'S GOING TO RAIN TOMORROW, SO YOU REALLY NEED TO GET
OVER THERE AND DO IT. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**SLIP A STATUS**

STATUS TRACKS ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS, WHICH AMOUNT TO BASICALLY
"STABLE" OR "SLIPPING." IF A STATUS TRACK HAS HIT CODE 30 OR BELOW, IT'S
SLIPPING, AND WILL KEEP GETTING WORSE FASTER AND FASTER. MECHANICALLY,
THIS HAPPENS QUICKLY BECAUSE IT IS A SOFT MOVE. THIS MOVE DESCRIBES IT
GETTING WORSE. FOR EXAMPLE:

*"YEAH, YOU RUN AND CATCH UP WITH THEM, BUT THAT CRACKED RIB FROM
EARLIER JUST ISN'T PUTTING UP WELL WITH THE EXERTION, AND SUDDENLY YOU
FEEL A STABBING PAIN IN YOUR RIGHT SIDE, AND IT'S HARDER TO BREATHE.
SLIP YOUR HEALTH STATUS TRACK DOWN TO CODE 20, PUNCTURED LUNG. WHAT DO
YOU DO?"*

**MAKE THEM CONJURE OR BUY**

SOMETIMES A PLAYER WILL ASK YOU IF THEIR MAGE HAS A CERTAIN ITEM, AND
YOU'RE NOT SURE. ONE THING TO DO IS TO TELL THEM THAT THEY DON'T, BUT
THEY KNOW WHERE THEY CAN BUY IT. OR SINCE THEY'RE MAGES, IF THEY CAN
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONJURE IT, THEY'RE WELCOME TO HAVE IT.

*"YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BLACK COHOSH FOR THAT HEALING POTION ON HAND, IT'S
ENDANGERED IN FACT. BUT YOU THINK ASHLEY AT THE LOCAL HERB SHOP MIGHT
HAVE SOME TUCKED AWAY IN THE LOCKED DISPLAY CASE. YOU REMEMBER IT BEING
PRETTY EXPENSIVE THOUGH. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**SHOW THEM THE DOWNSIDES OF THEIR PARADIGM**

THIS IS A WAY TO MAKE THE MAGES THINK ABOUT THEIR MAGIC. PUT THEM IN A
SITUATION WHERE THEIR PARADIGM, THEIR WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD, IS MORE
HINDRANCE THAN IT IS A HELP, AS OPPOSED TO NORMAL, WHERE IT IS LIKELY A
SOURCE OF FREEDOM AND AGENCY.

*"SO YOU'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS MEETING FOR A WHILE NOW, AND TO MAKE
SURE YOU'RE SUITABLY PREPARED, WERE GOING TO CONNECT WITH YOUR SOURCE.
SO YOU DO A LINE OF COKE, AND YOU KNOW HOW IT LETS YOU SEE THE TRUE
NATURE OF THINGS? YOU REALIZE YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE EVERYONE'S PERSONAL
DEMONS. THERE ARE SO MANY, IT'S GETTING HARD TO SEE, OR FOCUS. SOME OF
THEM MAKE IT HARD TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**INVENT A PREDICAMENT FOR SOMEONE**

PLAYERS WILL PUT THEIR MAGES IN ALL SORTS OF PREDICAMENTS ANYWAY, BUT
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO THROW AN UNEXPECTED ONE AT THEM, AND PUT THE MAGE
(NOT NECESSARILY THE PLAYER) ON THE SPOT.

*\"REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOUR SISTER SHOWED
UP? JUST AS YOU COMPLETE THE SPIRIT BINDING AND THE GEARS BEGIN TO TURN
ON THEIR OWN, YOU HEAR A POUNDING AT THE DOOR AND A FAMILIAR VOICE.
'RIVER! I KNOW YOU'RE HOME!' WHAT DO YOU DO?*

**RAISE THE STAKES**

THIS MEANS RAISING THE TENSION, PUTTING MORE ON THE LINE, OR OTHERWISE
UPPING THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THE MAGES HAVE IN THE OUTCOME OF A GIVEN
SITUATION. FOR EXAMPLE:

*"YOUR RITUAL GOES OFF WONDERFULLY, AND YOU'RE JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE DOWN
THE CIRCLE WHEN A SINISTER PRESENCE STEPS THROUGH THE GATE IN THE FENCE.
THEY LOOK AT YOU AND SAY IN A DEEP, RUMBLING VOICE 'YOU'VE STOPPED US
FROM POSSESSING ANY OF YOU, TRUE, BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO POSSESS THE
ENTIRE CITY, AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF YOU TO STOP THAT.' WHAT DO YOU
DO?"*

**INTRODUCE A LOOKOUT**

OFTENTIMES, MAGES TRY TO SET UP CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE FREE
USE OF THEIR MAGIC, WITHOUT ANYONE "SPYING" ON THEM FOR THE CONSENSUS.
THEY'LL MEET UP WITH OTHER MAGES IN SECRET BASEMENTS, SUMMON SPIRITS
DEEP IN THE WOODS, OR THEY SET UP A DISTRACTION FOR EVERYONE ELSE IN THE
AREA. SO IT CAN PROVIDE SOME COMPLICATIONS WHEN A LOOKOUT SHOWS UP OUT
OF NOWHERE. IF THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO RENDING MAGIC, THEY'LL EITHER HAVE TO
STOP, OR TRIGGER THE MOVE. AND IF THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO "QUESTIONABLY"
HARMONIOUS MAGIC, A LOOKOUT BEING THERE WILL LIKELY MAKE THEM HAVE TO
PULL ONE OVER TO KEEP IT FROM BEING RENDING.

*"THE TWO OF YOU HAVE JUST FINISHED LINING THE DOORWAY IN CHALK RUNES,
BUT BEFORE YOU CAN ACTIVATE THE PORTAL, A PATRON COMES IN FROM THE OTHER
SIDE. 'EXCUSE ME, IS THIS THE REFERENCE SECTION?' WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**THREATEN AN ANCHOR**

MUCH LIKE THE DEMAND UPKEEP FROM AN ANCHOR MOVE, THIS ONE IS A LITTLE
BIT MORE IMMEDIATE. CAPTURE THEIR COUSIN, OR SLAP A FORECLOSURE SIGN ON
THEIR HOUSE. REMEMBER, THEY HAVE TO GO DEAL WITH IT, OR WILL LOSE IT.

*"YOU GET HOME, EAGER TO TUNE UP YOUR MOTORCYCLE AND MAYBE GO FOR A
SPIN...AND INSTEAD FIND A TICKET WITH THE NUMBER OF A TOW TRUCK COMPANY!
WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

### SOFT OR HARD MOVES

**HIT THEM WITH THE STATIC REALITIES OF THEIR WORLD**

MAGES OFTEN WISH THEY LIVED IN A FULL FANTASY WORLD, BUT SADLY THEY DO
NOT. THE CONSENSUS HOLDS SWAY, AND IS STRONG. USE THIS MOVE WHEN THEY
COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE LIMITATIONS THAT EVEN MAGES FIND.

*"THE BUILDING IS OPPRESSIVE, AND YOU CAN FEEL THE WEIGHT OF DISBELIEF.
TRY AS YOU MIGHT, YOU CAN'T FIND THE KIND OF CONVENIENT, SHADOWED CORNER
YOU NEED TO HIDE A TRANSFORMATION. FLUORESCENT LIGHT BATHES EVERY INCH.
WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**ISOLATE THEM**

MAGES ARE MOST POWERFUL WHEN THEY ARE TOGETHER, EVEN IF THEIR
PERSONALITIES MAY CLASH. USE THIS WHEN YOU WANT TO SEPARATE ONE OR TWO
FROM OTHERS THEY EXPECTED TO BE WITH.

*"YOU SUDDENLY NOTICE THAT WHILE YOU WERE TALKING, THE SUN HAS SET, AND
NOW YOU'RE NOT SURE WHERE THE REST OF THE CABAL IS. YOU HEAR SIRENS IN
THE DISTANCE. WHAT DO YOU DO?"*

**USE ONE OF YOUR FORCE MOVES**

FORCES HAVE MOVES OF THEIR OWN, DICTATED BY THE STRESSOR THE FORCE
RELATES TO. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE MOVES WRITTEN ON YOUR FORCES SHEETS, AND
CAN USE ONE OF THEM JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MC MOVE.

*CONSIDER A GAME WITH A FORCE OF RATIONALITY-FOCUSED MAGES WHO SEEK TO
STAMP OUT MYSTERY, WONDER, AND CREATIVITY. THEY EXHIBIT THE STRESSOR
CONTROL, AND HAVE THE MOVE "BLACKMAIL THEM".*

*"WHEN YOU CHECK YOUR MAIL, YOU FIND AN ENVELOPE WITH NO RETURN ADDRESS
OR POSTMARK. INSIDE IS A PICTURE OF YOUR HOUSE, AND A LETTER THAT JUST
SAYS: 'WE KNOW YOU'RE BEHIND THE BLACKOUTS. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
SHOWING YOUR FACE TOMORROW.' WHAT DO YOU **DO**?"*

**DECLARE SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED ELSEWHERE**

YOU HAVE A PRINCIPLE TO THINK ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE, AND THIS IS A
DIRECT EXPRESSION OF THAT. "ELSEWHERE" SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT RELEVANT,
WHETHER SOMEWHERE THAT YOU KNOW THE MAGES WILL BE BACK TO, OR WHATEVER
HAPPENED THERE IS NOW COMING HERE.

*"WITH A START YOU REALIZE... IF ALL OF YOU ARE HERE, WHO'S WATCHING
AMANDA!? YOU HEAR A DEEP MOCKING LAUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
BUILDING."*

*"YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF SIRENS OFF IN THE DISTANCE. THEY COULD BE HEADED
THIS WAY, OR IT COULD BE A COINCIDENCE, BUT DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT
RISK?"*

**MAKE THEIR MOVE BACKFIRE**

MANY MOVES HAVE CLEAR WAYS THEY CAN GO WRONG. ATTACKS MISFIRE, PLANS
PLAY INTO AN ENEMY'S HANDS, INTIMATE MOMENTS SOUR. YOU CAN SHOW THE
WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR A MOVE, OR CAN SHOW SOMEONE ELSE DO IT
BETTER.

*"YOU CAST AROUND LOOKING FOR ANY PORT IN THIS RAGING STORM OF MAGICAL
ENERGY, AND YOU REALIZE THERE'S ONLY ONE SPOT. THE EYE OF THE STORM,
WHICH IS OCCUPIED BY THE BEAST ITSELF."*

*"YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK WITH THE FULL AUTHORITY OF THE WINTER COURT, TO
TELL THESE UPSTARTS THEIR PLACE, WHEN THE WINTER PRINCESS HERSELF STEPS
OUT FROM BEHIND A TREE AND SAYS 'ACTUALLY...'"*

### HARDER MOVES

**CHANGE THE BATTLEFIELD**

USE THIS WHEN YOU WANT TO THROW THE MAGES' CONTROL OF A SITUATION INTO
QUESTION. THIS CAN BE LIKE RAISE THE STAKES, BUT ENCOMPASSES THINGS THAT
ARE MORE OUT OF LEFT FIELD AS WELL. CHANGING THE "BATTLEFIELD" (EVEN IF
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST A PARLOUR FILLED WITH RELATIVES) CAN MEAN NEW FORCES
ARRIVE, AN ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT, OR REVEALING A DRAMATIC COMPLICATION.

*"SO YOU STEP SIDEWAYS, PLANNING TO PHASE OUT AND PHASE BACK IN, BUT
WHILE YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU SEE THIS VAST SPACE WITH CREEPY
FLOATING CREATURES, AND THEY'RE FIGHTING TO GET IN. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
BATTLE IS TAKING PLACE ON MORE PLANES THAN YOU KNEW.""EVERYONE'S
FIGHTING, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THINGS - AND THEN THE
GHOST PIRATE SHIP APPEARS, WITH GORDON DANGLING IN A CAGE OFF THE BOW.
THEY'RE ROWDY AND THEIR CANNONS ARE ARMED."*

**TAKE AWAY THINGS THEY EXPECT TO HAVE**

MOST OF THE TIME, YOU CAN ASSUME THE MAGES HAVE WHAT THEY NEED FOR WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO. A CELL PHONE, A BOTTLE OF WATER, BATTERIES. THIS
EXTENDS TO MORE RARE ITEMS, ONCE A MAGE HAS ACQUIRED IT AND MAKES A
POINT OF KEEPING IT AROUND. WHEN YOU USE THIS MOVE, SUDDENLY ALL THOSE
ASSUMPTIONS GO OUT THE WINDOW. IT CAN BE DIRECT AND IN THE MOMENT, LIKE
HAVING A BUSINESS CARD SNATCHED AWAY, OR IT COULD BE RETROSPECTIVE AND
ONLY NOW REALIZED, LIKE A WAND NOT BEING WHERE IT WAS LAST PUT DOWN.

*"SO YOU SHOOT THE HARPOON GUN, BUT YOU AREN'T BRACED AND THE GUN FLIES
OUT OF YOUR HANDS, BACKWARDS! YOUR TARGET FALLS, BUT ANOTHER GUY SEES
THAT YOU'RE UNARMED AND JUMPS AT YOU.""SOMETHING HAS GONE MYSTERIOUSLY
MISSING? HOW ABOUT THE GAS FOR YOUR BOAT. NOT THAT YOU'D NOTICE RIGHT
AWAY, OF COURSE."*

**IMPRISON SOMEONE**

MAGES' LIVES INVOLVE THE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM TO DO WHAT THEY BELIEVE,
AND SO IMPRISONMENT IS A PARTICULARLY STARK ACTION. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE TO A MAGE IN PARTICULAR, BUT IF IT INVOLVES ANYONE THEY CARE ABOUT,
IT CAN DRAMATICALLY SHAPE THEIR REACTIONS. IN A WORLD FULL OF POLICE,
GANGSTERS, MANIPULATIVE RELATIVES, AND MAGICAL BINDING CIRCLES,
"IMPRISONMENT" CAN TAKE MANY FORMS.

*"AS YOU LOOK AROUND THE BALLROOM, YOU NOTICE WHAT ARE CLEARLY
ENSORCELLED HUMANS SERVING DRINKS, AND WAIT, THAT'S THE MAN YOU SAVED
FROM DROWNING! AS DEAD-EYED AS THE REST OF THEM.""ALLISON OPENS THE DOOR
TO GET INTO THE TAXI, AND THE DRIVER LOOKS YOU IN THE EYE, AND AS YOU
RECOGNIZE HIM, SAYS 'MY LADY SENDS HER REGARDS,' AND DRIVES OFF BEFORE
YOU CAN REACT"*

**ADJUST A STATUS TRACK**

SOMETIMES A MAGE'S ACTIONS (OR INACTIONS) SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR AND
OBVIOUS IMPACT ON A STATUS TRACK, BUT THAT STATUS TRACK ISN'T YET
SLIPPING; OR MAYBE INCREASING ITS STATUS ISN'T WHAT MAKES SENSE. ADJUST
IT AS YOU SEE FIT: ADVANCE AN ANCHOR UPKEEP TRACK, DE-ESCALATE A FRONT
TRACK, OR EVEN REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF A MAGE'S HEALTH STATUS.

*"AS YOU FINISH YOUR IMPASSIONED SPEECH AND LOOK OUT OVER THE CROWD, YOU
REALIZE IT'S FALLING FLAT; THEY AREN'T BUYING IT. AND THEN THEY START
JEERING, AND YOU SEE YOUR CREDIBILITY SLIPPING AWAY. SET YOUR CONSENSUS
SHIFT STATUS TRACK BACK TO 40."*

*"IT'S BEEN A BUSY TIME FOR YOU ALL, HASN'T IT? POLICE CALLED BECAUSE OF
THE FRATERNITY TWICE, POSITION AS A SOCIAL HUB HAS BEEN FALLING BECAUSE
THE COOLEST KIDS ARE GOING EVERYWHERE BUT TO YOU FOR THEIR PARTIES, AND
NOW THAT PIPER'S STAYING THERE THINGS ARE GETTING TENSE. YOU GET A
LETTER FROM THE ADMINISTRATION, THE FRATERNITY IS OFFICIALLY ON
PROBATION."* WHILE YOU MARK OFF ANOTHER CODE ON THE HOME FRONT STATUS
TRACK.*"SURE, YOUR MAGIC CENTERS AROUND THE BREATH OF LIFE. AS YOU SPEAK
SOOTHING WORDS, HE BREATHES EASIER. LAZARUS, HEAL 1 HARM."*

**ADD A RESTRICTION TO A MAGE'S PARADIGM**

A MAGE'S PARADIGM IS INHERENT AND INTUITIVE, AND SOMETIMES IT MIGHT TAKE
SOME EXPLORATION TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF IT. SOMETIMES THAT
EXPLORATION RE-CATEGORIZES CERTAIN THINGS FROM 'WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
FINAGLE A WAY TO DO THAT' TO 'THAT'S FLAT-OUT IMPOSSIBLE AND I CAN'T
BELIEVE WE EVER THOUGHT OTHERWISE.\" WHEN A MAGE ATTEMPTS AN EDGE-CASE
USE OF MAGIC AND IT DOESN'T GO IN THEIR FAVOR, THAT'S A GOOD TIME TO ADD
A RESTRICTION TO THEIR PARADIGM TO REFLECT THAT UPDATE TO THEIR MAGICAL
APPROACH.

*"SO HIS FIST IS COMING FOR YOUR HEAD, AND AS YOUR SELF-PROTECTIVE
INSTINCTS TAKE OVER, YOU TRY TO YANK AT HIS LIFE-THREAD TO THROW HIM OFF
BALANCE. BUT YOU CAN'T GET A GRIP ON IT, AND HE KEEPS COMING. IT OCCURS
TO YOU AS YOUR HEAD RINGS FROM THE IMPACT THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ROOM
IN YOUR PARADIGM FOR SELFISH ACTS. ADD A RESTRICTION TO YOUR PARADIGM:
SELF-DEFENSE IS CONSIDERED SELFISH."*

*"SO YOU REACH OUT FOR GHOSTS UNDER THE SEA - AND GET NOTHING AT ALL.
MAYBE THIS IS WHY GHOST PIRATES ALWAYS HAVE A SHIP. ADD THIS
RESTRICTION: THE SEA'S VASTNESS OUTDOES MORTAL MAGIC.""YOU TRY TO SPEAK
ACROSS BOUNDARIES TO HIM, BUT IT'S LIKE HIS MIND IS A MIRRORED SPHERE.
YOU CAN'T REACH HIM, AND ADD THE RESTRICTION, 'THE CLOSE-MINDED HEARS
ONLY THEMSELVES.'"*

**ASSIGN DISCORD**

DISCORD IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN REALITY BENDS AROUND A MAGE LIKE A SPRING.
IT HASN'T GIVEN YET, BUT SOMETHING IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN. RENDING
MAGIC THAT AFFECTS A LOOKOUT ALWAYS PRODUCES SOME, BUT SOMETIMES OTHER
SOURCES OF DISCORD WILL FOLLOW FROM THE FICTION.

*"YOU'RE USED TO HAVING THAT LITTLE HARMONIOUS SPELL THAT KEEPS YOUR
GARDEN PEST-FREE GOING, BUT JUST AS JACK, YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR, COMES OVER,
AND THEIR EYES GLANCE OVER THE PERFECTLY-FORMED LEAVES, YOU FEEL A
SUDDEN LURCH. TAKE 1 DISCORD. 'I'M LOOKING FORWARDS ****SO**** MUCH TO
GETTING TO KNOW YOU,' SAYS JACK, EYES GLEAMING UNPLEASANTLY. WHAT DO YOU
DO?"*

*"YOU'RE NOT WORKING AT ALL WITHIN THE LOCAL EXPECTATIONS. YOUR CAMERA
FLASHLIGHT CAN WORK TO ILLUMINATE GLAMOUR, BUT TAKE 2 DISCORD.""THE
RITUAL IS BEING RESISTED BY SOMETHING WITH A DEEP HOLD OVER THIS PLACE.
YOU ALL TAKE 1 DISCORD, AND AT THIS RATE IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE."*

**DEAL DAMAGE**

THE LIFE OF A MAGE IS DANGEROUS, AND DANGER OFTEN INVOLVES PAIN. WHEN
THEY FALL, WHEN THEY'RE STRUCK, WHEN THEY DEIGN TO TINKER WITH UNTESTED
EQUIPMENT WHILE NOT WEARING PPE, DEAL DAMAGE AND HAVE THEM ROLL TO
SUFFER HARM.

*"EVEN AS YOU TUG HAPHAZARDLY AT THE TANGLE OF WIRES, YOU REALIZE THE
MOMENT WHEN 'DOWN TO THE WIRE' BECOMES 'TOO LATE,' AND YOU AREN'T GOING
TO DEFUSE THE BOMB IN TIME. YOU SCRAMBLE BACKWARDS AS IT TICKS DOWN TO
ZERO, AND ARE THROWN BACK WITH THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION. TAKE FOUR
HARM."*

*"SO THERE'S THIS BIG BOOM FROM OUT ON THE WATER, AND HUGE DROPLETS
SPILL DOWN ON YOU - AND HAND-SIZED SWORDFISH. ONE GETS YOU RIGHT IN THE
SHOULDER. TAKE 2 HARM.""IT'S TRIDENT AGAINST TRIDENT, AND YOU STAB HIM
GOOD, BUT HE GOT YOU, TOO, WITH A GLANCING BLOW. 1 HARM."*

**MAKE THEM BACKLASH**

MAGIC IN A CONSENSUS THAT DENIES ITS EXISTENCE CARRIES ITS OWN INHERENT
RISK. THAT RISK MOST OFTEN MANIFESTS IN THE FORM OF BACKLASH. USE THIS
MOVE WHEN A SPELL GOES SIDEWAYS, A SPIRIT GETS AWAY FROM THEM, OR A MAGE
REACHES TOO FAR.

\"*IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE TRIED USING MAGIC TO CHANGE YOUR OWN
APPEARANCE, AND YOU'RE WRESTLING WITH YOUR OWN MIND AS IT CLINGS TO YOUR
ESTABLISHED SELF-IMAGE. IT TAKES ALL YOUR WILLPOWER TO SILENCE THAT
INTERNAL DISSENT, BUT YOU'RE ON THE VERGE OF SUCCEEDING--UNTIL YOU CATCH
A GLIMPSE OF YOUR DISTORTED REFLECTION ON THE WINDOW. THE UNFINISHED
SPELL SHATTERS AND TURNS AGAINST YOU. ROLL BACKLASH.\"*

*"AS YOU AND GEORGE LOCK EYES, YOU FEEL ALL THAT DISCORD BOUNCING AROUND
INSIDE YOU TRYING TO GET OUT, AND SUDDENLY - IT DOES."*

RUNNING A SESSION
-----------------

A SESSION OF CONSENSUS IS A SELF-CONTAINED ADVANCE OF THE STORY. IT WILL
BUILD ON WHAT CAME BEFORE AND SET UP NEW DIRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE, BUT
IT HAS A BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND END, AND SHOULD ALWAYS CHANGE THE GAME
WORLD IN WAYS NOT EASILY UNDONE.

### STARTING A SESSION

YOUR MC SHEET HAS A LIST OF STEPS TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF
THE SESSION.

**GATHER THE MC SHEET, PC SUMMARY SHEET, FRONTS, FLAGS, AND
FORESHADOWS**

THESE COVER ALL THE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE
TABLE HAS AVAILABLE.

**LOOK OVER AND READ OUT FLAGS, NOTE WHICH ONES CAN BE CHANGED**

FLAGS ARE ONE OF THE MAIN METHODS THAT ALLOW MAGES TO MARK EXPERIENCE,
SO EVERYONE SHOULD BE REMINDED OF THEM AND BE ABLE TO REFERENCE THEM. IN
ADDITION, FLAGS WHICH HAVE BEEN HIT AT LEAST ONCE ARE AVAILABLE TO BE
CHANGED IF THE PLAYER WISHES, SO REMIND THEM OF THAT.

**MARK ONE CODE OFF EVERY FORESHADOW STATUS TRACK**

FORESHADOWS HAVE A FAIRLY SHORT LIFESPAN, SO THAT THEY WILL BE BROUGHT
UP AGAIN BEFORE THEY FADE OUT OF MEMORY. IF YOU MARK OFF CODE N OF THE
FORESHADOW, IT SHOULD COME UP FAIRLY EARLY IN THE SESSION.

**MARK ONE CODE OFF EVERY ANCHOR STATUS TRACK**

ANCHORS REQUIRE MAINTENANCE. THE STATUS TRACKS ADVANCING REPRESENT THIS.

**NOTE ALL SLIPPING STATUS TRACKS**

STATUS TRACKS WHICH ARE SLIPPING ARE VERY RELEVANT DURING THIS SESSION.
THEY SHOULD FEEL LIKE WHATEVER THEY ARE CONNECTED TO IS BEGINNING TO
SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL, OR FALL OUT OF REACH, OR COME TO AN INEXORABLE
CONCLUSION. ADVANCING A SLIPPING STATUS TRACK IS A SOFT MOVE, SO YOU CAN
DO IT ALMOST ANY TIME IT MAKES SENSE, AND GOING OVER THEM AT THE START
OF THE SESSION WILL HELP YOU THINK OF IT. WRITE THE SLIPPING STATUS
TRACKS ON YOUR MC SHEET.

**REVIEW ANY EFFECTS THAT LAST SESSION WERE DECIDED TO BE EXTENDED INTO
THIS ONE**

SOME GAME EFFECTS LAST "FOR THE REST OF THE SESSION", BUT MIGHT COME UP
NEAR THE END OF ONE. THIS LETS YOU EXTEND THINGS THAT SEEM WORTH IT,
LIKE A BONUS OR PENALTY THAT HASN'T COME INTO PLAY YET.

**PERFORM MOVES TRIGGERED AT START OF SESSION**

REMIND THE PLAYERS TO PERFORM MOVES ON THEIR SHEETS WHICH ARE TRIGGERED
AT THE START OF THE SESSION. MUCH LIKE WITH LOVE LETTERS, THESE WON'T
START THE ACTION EXACTLY, EVEN ON A 6-, BUT THEY DO PREPARE THINGS.

**FRAME A SCENE AND MAKE A SOFT MOVE**

NOW, YOU HAVE SEEN ALL OF THE PIECES YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH. FAIRLY
ABSTRACTLY, THERE ARE THE MAGES WITH THEIR HOPES AND DESIRES, AND THE
FORCES RELEVANT TO THEIR WORLD. MORE URGENTLY, THERE ARE FORESHADOWS,
ANCHORS, AND OTHER STATUS TRACKS THAT ARE DEMANDING ATTENTION, AND YOU
MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOLD TO MAKE MOVES. NOW, FRAME A SCENE ACCORDING
TO THE RULES BELOW, AND OPEN THE ACTION WITH A SOFT MOVE, TO REQUIRE A
RESPONSE, AND YOU'RE OFF.

### SCENE FRAMING AND SPOTLIGHT

CONSENSUS IS PLAYED OUT IN SCENES. EACH ONE SHOULD GO AS LONG AS IT
NEEDS TO BUT NO LONGER. THIS USUALLY MEANS ABOUT 15-30 MINUTES, BUT YOU
WILL FIND WHAT RHYTHMS WORK FOR YOUR TABLE.

A SCENE INVOLVES ONE OR MORE OF THE MAGES. ONE OF YOUR JOBS IS TO MANAGE
THE "SPOTLIGHT", MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS SOME TIME WITH SCENES
FOCUSED ON THEM AND DOESN'T GO TOO LONG AWAY FROM THE ACTION. SOME
SESSIONS MAY HAVE MOST OR ALL OF THE MAGES TOGETHER IN THE SAME SCENES,
BUT OFTEN THE MAGES WILL WANT TO GO THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS. LOOK OUT
FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW THEM TOGETHER IN TWOS OR THREES, BUT DON'T
NEGLECT INDIVIDUAL SCENES WHEN THEY FIT. WHEN YOU ARE DECIDING ON A NEW
SCENE, THINK ABOUT WHO HASN'T BEEN CENTRAL RECENTLY, AND SEE IF YOU CAN
FRAME ONE AROUND THEM.

ALL SCENES SHOULD FALL INTO AT LEAST ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES: "ANCHOR
SCENES", "INSPIRATION SCENES", AND "FORCE SCENES". THE CATEGORIES SERVE
DIFFERENT PURPOSES, FOR THE MAGES' GOALS AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE
STORY. IF YOU KNOW WHICH MAGES ARE GOING TO BE IN A NEW SCENE, THEIR
LAST KNOWN POSITIONS OR THEIR GOALS MAY DICTATE OR INSPIRE WHAT CATEGORY
THE SCENE SHOULD BE. OR, YOU MAY KNOW WHAT CATEGORY OF SCENE COMES NEXT,
AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE GOING ON AND SO WHAT MAGES WOULD BE
INVOLVED. IF YOU ONLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, NOT WHO IS INVOLVED OR WHICH
CATEGORY IT SHOULD BE, THINK ABOUT THE CATEGORY FIRST, AND THEN SET THE
SCENE WITH MAGES WHO INSPIRE THAT KIND OF SCENE. WE FIND THE GAME FEELS
BEST WHEN YOU KEEP A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TYPES OF SCENES, ROUGHLY 1/3 OF
EACH IN A GIVEN SESSION. OF COURSE SOME SESSIONS WILL INVOLVE A LOT MORE
PARADIGM DISCUSSION THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AND THAT'S OKAY, BUT WHEN YOU'RE
GUIDING THE SCENES, KEEP THE 1/3 RULE IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND.

#### ANCHOR SCENES

ONE OF THE CENTRAL TENSIONS OF A MAGE'S LIFE IS FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE
ONE FOOT IN EACH OF TWO WORLDS. SOMETIMES THEY'RE PROBABLY LATE TO WORK
BECAUSE A SPELL TOOK LONGER THAN EXPECTED. SOMETIMES THEY MISS THE
MIDNIGHT FULL MOON RITUAL TIME BECAUSE THEIR PARENT IS SICK IN THE
HOSPITAL. SOMETIMES THEIR AUNT JUNE WANTS THEM TO GO TO A CRAFT FAIR ON
SUNDAY BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD QUALITY TIME IN FOREVER, BUT THERE'S A
SPIRIT KILLING PEOPLE ON THE LOOSE, AND SUNDAY IS THE ONLY TIME THE REST
OF YOUR CABAL CAN GET TOGETHER TO STOP IT.

ANCHOR SCENES ARE ABOUT WHAT KEEPS OUR MAGES HUMAN, AND TETHERED TO THE
HUMAN WORLD. AN EXAMPLE MIGHT BE A SCENE SPENDING TIME WITH THEIR
CONNECTION ANCHOR (AUNT JUNE) DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY BOTH ENJOY
(GOING TO A CRAFT FAIR). ANOTHER MIGHT BE A SCENE OF SCROUNGING AND
DOING ODD JOBS IN ORDER TO AFFORD RENT ON THEIR SHELTER ANCHOR. THESE
CAN TAKE MANY FORMS, BUT IN GENERAL THEY ARE THE MOST GROUNDED SCENES IN
CONSENSUS. DURING AN ANCHOR SCENE IS ALSO WHEN A MAGE CAN REFRESH THEIR
PREPARATIONS, SO LONG AS THE ANCHOR THAT THE SCENE IS BASED ON ISN'T
SLIPPING. OFTEN AN ANCHOR SCENE WILL BE ABOUT UPKEEPING THE ANCHOR OR
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ANCHOR, AND THUS WILL CLEAR THAT ANCHOR'S STATUS
TRACK.

IF THE ANCHOR **IS** SLIPPING, THEN THERE WILL BE SOMETHING KEY GOING ON
THAT, IF NOT ADDRESSED, WILL CAUSE THE MAGE TO LOSE THE ANCHOR. THIS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BEFORE THE SCENE, IF EVENTS HAVE MADE IT
CLEAR, OR IT MIGHT NEED TO BE DETERMINED AS THE SCENE BEGINS. WHATEVER
IT IS, THIS MAKES THE SCENE MORE URGENT, EVEN IF THE MAGE IS TRYING TO
STAY COOL. IN THIS CASE, FOCUS ON THE REAL IMPORTANCE OF THE MAGE'S
CHOICES, AND HOW THEY STILL CAN KEEP THE ANCHOR, IF THEY'RE WILLING TO
WORK AT IT. IF THE MAGE IS SUCCESSFUL AT RECONNECTING WITH THEIR ANCHOR,
CLEAR THE STATUS TRACK. THEY HAVE A REPRIEVE, FOR NOW. IF THEY AREN'T...
REFER TO SLIPPING STATUS TRACKS AND THE MOVE **LOSE AN ANCHOR**.

#### INSPIRATION SCENES

MANY MAGES HAVE BIG, SWEEPING IDEAS ABOUT THE WORLD, THE UNIVERSE, AND
THEIR PLACE IN IT. MAGES WHO DON'T STILL TEND TO FIND THEMSELVES
BRUSHING UP AGAINST QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS, WHETHER THEY LIKE IT
OR NOT. INSPIRATION SCENES FOCUS IN ON THIS ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES,
SEEING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MAGES GET TALKING.

THEY ARE CALLED INSPIRATION SCENES BECAUSE A MAGES' INSPIRATIONS, OR
POTENTIAL INSPIRATIONS, ARE VERY COMMON SOURCES OF THESE EVENTS. TWO
MAGES HAVING A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT NOT ONLY THEIR PARADIGMS BUT WHAT
THE DIFFERENCES MEAN TO HOW THEY ACCOMPLISH THINGS IN THE WORLD AND HOW
THEY FEEL ABOUT THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM WILL PROBABLY BECOME INSPIRATIONS
FOR EACH OTHER. THIS ALSO COVERS MORE ESOTERIC SCENES LIKE A MAGE
DECIDING TO REALLY GET TO KNOW THE SPIRIT THAT LIVES IN THEIR WAND.

INSPIRATION SCENES CAN BE TRICKY BECAUSE THEY'RE A LESS-COMMON TYPE OF
SCENE TO SEE IN A ROLEPLAYING GAME. HOWEVER, PLAYERS OFTEN REALLY DO
ENJOY THEM. LOOK OUT FOR WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE A MAGE COULD HAVE A GOOD
TIME TEACHING, LEARNING, OR JUST TALKING, AND GIVE THEM INSPIRATION
SCENES TO PLAY IT OUT.

#### FORCE SCENES

A FORCE SCENE IS A GOAL-SEEKING SCENE. EITHER A FORCE IS WORKING TOWARDS
THEIR GOALS, AND THE MAGES EITHER HELP OR HINDER, OR THE MAGES HAVE A
GOAL, WHICH VARIOUS FORCES WILL HELP OR HINDER.

AS THE SCENE STARTS, IF THE MAGES INVOLVED ALREADY HAVE A CLEAR GOAL,
YOUR MOVES PRESENT INTERESTING CHOICES AND CHALLENGES. IF THEY DO NOT
AND ARE BEING MORE REACTIVE TO A FORCE, THEN START WITH A SOFT MOVE THAT
GIVES THE MAGES SOMETHING TO REACT TO, AND THEREFORE A GOAL.

CONTINUE UNTIL IT'S CLEAR WHAT THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE. IF THERE'S A
CONFLICT AND IT BECOMES CLEAR THE MAGES HAVE THE UPPER HAND, GO AHEAD
AND WRAP UP AND MOVE TO THE NEXT SCENE. IF NO CLARITY IS COMING, THAT
TELLS YOU THAT INSTEAD OF A RESOLUTION, FURTHER SCENES WILL BE NEEDED TO
SEE MORE SIDES OF THESE EVENTS. WRAP IT UP SO THAT IT DOESN'T DRAG ON,
AND START LATER SCENES REACTING TO THE ONGOING STATUS.

### ENDING A SESSION

AT SOME POINT, IT WILL BE THE RIGHT TIME TO END THE SESSION. MAYBE THE
PLAYERS WILL HAVE TIME CONSTRAINTS, OR A SIGNIFICANT CLIMAX WAS REACHED
IN THE STORY AND EVERYONE WILL NEED SOME TIME TO PROCESS, OR MAYBE
EVERYONE IS JUST GETTING ANTSY. THIS IS OFTEN AROUND 3 HOURS, BUT REALLY
DOES VARY HUGELY BY TABLE. WHEN IT IS TIME, AFTER THE SCENE WRAPS UP,
ANNOUNCE IT IS THE END OF THE SESSION, AND READ OUT THE MOVE:

AT THE END OF SESSION: NOTE ANY EFFECTS THAT LASTED "UNTIL END OF
SESSION," BUT SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT. THEN, ASK YOURSELVES THESE
QUESTIONS AS A GROUP. FOR EVERY ONE YOU ANSWER "YES" TO, EVERYONE MARKS
EXPERIENCE.

-   DID YOU SHOW THE LENGTHS YOU WERE WILLING TO GO TO IN ORDER TO
    MAINTAIN AN ANCHOR?

-   DID YOU UNCOVER A SECRET?

-   DID YOU LEARN SOMETHING THAT PUTS YOUR PARADIGMS IN PERSPECTIVE, OR
    CAUSED YOU TO QUESTION THEM?

-   DID YOU EXPOSE THE DEPTHS OF YOUR HUMANITY, TO YOURSELF OR TO
    SOMEONE ELSE?

-   DID YOU WITNESS LOSS, SELFISHNESS, OR PAIN BORN OF MAGIC?

EFFECTS THAT LAST "UNTIL END OF SESSION" BUT MIGHT CONTINUE INTO THE
NEXT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF DISCORD IN THE
BACKLASH MOVE. IF IT HAPPENED IN THE LAST SCENE, FOR EXAMPLE, ITS FULL
WEIGHT PROBABLY WON'T HAVE BEEN FELT, SO IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE WORTH
EXTENDING INTO THE NEXT SESSION. HOWEVER, DON'T FEEL OBLIGATED, IF
SOMETHING ALREADY SEEMS PLAYED OUT, OR IS OTHERWISE NO LONGER
INTERESTING.

YOUR SHEETS
-----------

THESE SHEETS HELP YOU ORGANIZE YOUR THOUGHTS AND ARE MORE TOOLS FOR
KEEPING THE GAME RUNNING.

### THE MC

THIS SHEET SHOULD BE FRONT-AND-CENTER. IT REMINDS YOU OF YOUR AGENDA AND
PRINCIPLES, AND LISTS ALL OF YOUR MOVES, ARRANGED FROM HARD MOVES TO
SOFT MOVES TO HELP PROMPT YOU WHEN IT'S TIME TO MAKE ONE. IT ALSO HAS A
PLACE TO LIST ALL THE CURRENTLY-SLIPPING STATUS TRACKS, SO THAT THEY ARE
NEVER FAR FROM YOUR MIND (AND NEVER FAR FROM THE SLIP A STATUS TRACK
MOVE).

### PC SUMMARIES

THIS SHEET COLLAPSES THE ESSENTIAL DETAILS OF THE MAGES DOWN TO THE SIZE
OF CARDS. ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE CAMPAIGN, IT CAN HELP YOU REFER TO THE
MAGES BY THEIR NAMES, AND MEANS YOU DON'T CONSTANTLY HAVE TO ASK "WHAT
ARE YOUR OPPOSED ASPECTS AGAIN? AND WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S NAME?". YOU
DON'T NEED TO OBSESSIVELY TRACK EVERY SINGLE DETAIL OF THE CHARACTERS
HERE, BUT KEEP THE BROAD STROKES.

### FORCES

FORCES ARE YOUR MAIN ORGANIZATIONAL TOOL FOR NOTABLE ELEMENTS IN THE
WORLD, AND THE SHEETS COLLECT ALL THE RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM.
KEEPING THEM CLOSE AT HAND WILL HELP YOU MAKE FORCE MOVES, OR REALIZE
WHAT FORCE TO BRING IN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE. DO KEEP
THEM UPDATED, AS THEIR STATUS TRACKS CHANGE, AS CAST MEMBERS COME AND
GO, AND AS YOU ASSOCIATE CUSTOM MOVES AND OTHER DETAILS WITH THEM.

IT'S OK TO WRITE SOME SPECULATION ON FORCE SHEETS, BUT REMEMBER NOT TO
ACTUALLY PLAN ANYTHING. AS SUCH, IT SHOULD BE FINE FOR A PLAYER TO SEE
ONE, SINCE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY DEEP DARK SECRETS YOU ARE SCHEMING TO
UNVEIL AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT.

SUNDRIES
--------

SOME THINGS TO REMEMBER.

WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY, AND PICKING A MOVE,
REMEMBER THAT THE GAME'S RULES WILL INFLUENCE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A MAGE ROLLS THE SUFFER HARM MOVE, ON A 7-9, THE MC
CHOOSES AN OPTION. SO YOU CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS, AND SINCE THE
PRINCIPLES SAY TO STAY IN THE NARRATIVE, YOU DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS TO
THE MAGE BASED ON WHICH OPTION YOU CHOOSE.

YOUR FORCES WILL ALSO INFORM WHAT YOU SAY. NOT ONLY FROM THEIR FORCE
MOVES, BUT FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A RITUAL DRAWS UNWANTED ATTENTION, YOU
SHOULD LOOK AT YOUR FORCES TO SEE WHICH ONES MIGHT COUNT AS "UNWANTED
ATTENTION" FOR THAT PARTICULAR RITUAL.

LIKE WE MENTIONED ABOVE, SOMETIMES YOU'LL WANT TO TURN QUESTIONS BACK ON
THE PERSON WHO ASKED THEM, OR TURN THEM OVER TO THE GROUP AT LARGE.
*"THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, WHO ARE THE FRAT HOUSE'S BIGGEST RIVALS?"*

SOMETIMES YOU'LL WANT TO LET YOUR NARRATION WANDER A LITTLE BIT. IMAGINE
LOOKING IDLY AT THE SCENE, LIKE YOU'VE PAUSED A MOVIE, AND NOTICE SOME
DETAIL, SOMETHING NOT AT ALL RELEVANT OR MATERIAL TO THE SCENE, AND
DESCRIBE IT. FOR EXAMPLE, *"HERE'S NO HEATER IN THIS BASEMENT, BUT THERE
IS AN INTRICATE SYMBOL ETCHED INTO THE WALL. IT LOOKS FADED NOW, BUT YOU
CAN JUST CATCH A SENSE OF HEAT, AND LOOKING DEEPER INTO IT THE LINES
CURVE IN ON THEMSELVES LIKE LICKING TONGUES OF FLAME..."*

ZOOM IN AND OUT OF SCENES SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES YOU'LL WANT TO PLAN OUT A
RITUAL IN EXACTING DETAIL, AND DESCRIBE EVERYONE'S EVERY MOTION AS THEY
CONTRIBUTE TO IT, BUT THEN PARTWAY THROUGH THE RITUAL, SAY "AND THE REST
OF IT GOES OFF WITHOUT A HITCH." SAME GOES FOR BETWEEN SESSIONS.
SOMETIMES YOU'LL WANT TO PICK UP MOMENTS AFTER THE LAST SESSION
FINISHED, OTHER TIMES YOU CAN MAKE IT DAYS OR WEEKS LATER. USE YOUR
JUDGEMENT, AND DO WHAT'S FUN FOR YOU AND THE REST OF THE TABLE.

SOMETIMES YOU'LL WANT TO ZOOM IN ON A MOVE TOO, OUTMANEUVERING SOMEONE
MIGHT MEAN PARKOUR OVER A WALL AND CROSSING 10 FEET OF DISTANCE. IT
MIGHT ALSO MEAN STAYING AHEAD OF THEIR SEARCH TEAMS FOR THE NEXT WEEK.
YOU CAN USE MOVES TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IN VERY ZOOMED IN SCENES, AND
VERY ZOOMED OUT ONES AS WELL.

TAKE BREAKS WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT. THE GAME TAKING PLACE IN SCENES GIVES
YOU A LOT OF STOPPING POINTS, AND THOUGH SOMETIMES YOU'LL WANT TO
CONTINUE STRAIGHT ON TO THE NEXT ONE, SOMETIMES IT WILL FEEL BETTER TO
TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO STRETCH, REFILL DRINKS, AND SO ON. PAY ATTENTION
TO WHEN THE ENERGY AT THE TABLE IS FLAGGING AND IT MIGHT BE WORTH
EVERYONE CLEARING THEIR HEADS. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED WITH A LITTLE
PHYSICAL MOTION CAN DO FOR YOUR ENERGY. CONVERSELY, A SHORT BREAK AT A
CLIFFHANGER CAN HELP MAKE THINGS MORE INTENSE. I USUALLY FIND THAT ABOUT
THREE BREAKS DURING A THREE TO FOUR HOUR SESSION FEELS RIGHT, TWO SHORT
AND ONE LONG.

\newpage

STACKING MOVES
==============

SOMETIMES, MAYBE EVEN OFTEN, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ZOOMED IN ON A
SCENE, A SINGLE MOVE ISN'T ENOUGH TO RESOLVE AN INTERACTION. 7-9 RESULTS
CAN BE FOLLOWED UP ON, OR LEAVE THINGS DANGLING. MOVES CAN TRIGGER OTHER
MOVES, THEY CAN OVERLAP, THEY CAN NEST WITHIN EACH OTHER, YOU COULD END
UP WITH A CHAIN OF MOVES THAT'S 5 OR 6 DEEP FAIRLY EASILY. THAT'S OKAY,
JUST REMEMBER THAT IF A MOVE IS TRIGGERED, IT MUST BE ROLLED, AND THE
FICTIONAL RESULTS HAPPEN, AND IN ORDER TO ROLL A MOVE, THE TRIGGER
CONDITION MUST FIRST BE MET IN THE FICTION.

HERE WE PROVIDE AN EXTENDED EXAMPLE TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND BETTER.

ZURI THE PRIMORDIAL IS GOING TO TALK TO SOME LIBRARIANS SHE SUSPECTS
MIGHT BE INVOLVED WITH THE WINTER COURT. SHE FINDS LILA AND HECTOR AT A
CAFE, HAVING LUNCH.

"DO THEY HAVE ANY TELLTALE SIGNS OF THE WINTER COURT AROUND THEM?" ASKS
HER PLAYER.

"YEAH, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CHILLED RESONANCE, BUT MAYBE JUST ON
THEIR CLOTHES," I SAY, **GIVING THEM AN ANSWER THEY WON'T LIKE**. AND
THEN I REMEMBER TO BE GENEROUS WITH THE TRUTH, AND SAY "YEAH, DEFINITELY
JUST ON THEIR CLOTHES. WHICH MEANS IT'S A SURFACE-LEVEL ENCHANTMENT."

"OK, I JUST LEARNED MY WORST FEARS ARE CONFIRMED, FASTER THAN I
EXPECTED, BUT I DID KIND OF SEE IT COMING. SO....I USE HUNTER TO TRACK
MY PREY'S MAGICAL TRAIL!"

"COOL, WHAT PREY, AND WHAT DO YOU DO TO TRACK THEM?"

"THE WINTER COURT! UH, OH RIGHT, I PROBABLY CAN'T PICK UP THEIR TRAIL
WITHOUT CAUSING A SCENE, CAN I?"

"NOT REALLY, YOU ARE IN PUBLIC."

"FINE, THEN I ...CALL MY FRIEND ESIN (A PLAYER CHARACTER, AN INSPIRED).
THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO! AND I SIT DOWN, AND START TRYING TO FIND
OUT WHERE THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN ENCHANTED. THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW, BUT
I'LL ASK WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING RECENTLY AND LISTEN FOR ANYTHING OUT OF
THE ORDINARY OR OUT OF PLACE."

I'M STILL BEING GENEROUS WITH THE TRUTH, SO I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ZURI
FIGHT TO FIND OUT. BUT, WHILE I KNOW IT HAPPENED WHILE THEY WERE AT
WORK, I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHICH FAE GOT TO THEM. SO, I TURN IT BACK ON
ZURI'S PLAYER, SAYING,

"THEY MOSTLY TALK ABOUT INTERESTING OR FUNNY PATRONS AT THE LIBRARY. ONE
STANDS OUT TO YOU, SOUNDING LIKE A FAE SHE KNOWS OF, FROM THE WINTER
COURT. WHO IS IT?"

ZURI'S PLAYER INSTANTLY REACTS. "OH, IT MUST HAVE BEEN HOB. HE SEEMS
LIKE HE WOULD LIKE THE TWO OF THEM."

OH, HOB, THAT'S GOOD, I DIDN'T REALIZE HE'D MADE SUCH AN IMPRESSION ON
THEM. I DRAW LINES FROM HIM TO THE TWO LIBRARIANS ON THE WINTER COURT
FRONT SHEET. THIS CONVERSATION CAN EASILY HAVE TAKEN THE TIME IT WOULD
NEED FOR ESIN TO ARRIVE, SO I SAY,

"SO YOU REALIZE THEY'RE DESCRIBING HOB, TALL, THIN, BUT NOT LANKY, AND
THEY BRING HIM UP AS SOMEONE REALLY INTERESTING, BUT THEN SORT OF TRAIL
OFF TRYING TO DESCRIBE HIM. DEFINITELY SOUNDS LIKE AN ENCHANTMENT.
BEFORE YOU'RE ABLE TO TRY AND PROBE FOR MORE, ESIN ARRIVES, AND COMES TO
SIT DOWN WITH YOU."

EISEN'S PLAYER LOOKS THOUGHTFUL. "WHEN I GET THERE, IS MY SOURCE THERE?"
I LOOK DOWN AT MY PC SUMMARY SHEET AND SEE THAT EISEN'S SOURCE IS NEW
MUSIC, SO I **OFFER OPPORTUNITY, WITH OR WITHOUT A COST**, SAYING "WELL,
IT'S A LIBRARY, SO THERE'S NO MUSIC PLAYING THERE UNLESS YOU BRING IT.
DID YOU COME WITH YOUR HEADPHONES ON, AND A FEW NEW SONGS LOADED UP?"
EISEN'S PLAYER ANSWERS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, TELLING ME THAT THEY'RE
LISTENING TO ONE OF THE SONGS AS THEY WALK IN, SO THEIR **SOURCE** MOVE
IS TRIGGERED, AND THEY HOLD 3.

EISEN'S PLAYER CONTINUES, "I WANT TO OFFER MY HEADPHONES TO HECTOR, AND
I SAY, 'YOU'VE GOTTA HEAR THIS, IT'S BLOWING MY MIND MAN.'"

I THINK ABOUT WHETHER THE PLAYER MIGHT NEED TO ROLL **USE A SLEEPER**,
BUT ULTIMATELY DECIDE THAT IT'S PRETTY NORMAL AND HECTOR WOULD JUST TAKE
THEM. SO I DESCRIBE HECTOR PUTTING ON A HEADPHONE, AND KIND OF NODDING
THEIR HEAD ALONG TO THE BEAT, THEN TAKING THE OTHER TO HEAR BETTER. "IT
SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE **OPENED THEIR MIND** TO YOUR SOURCE, EISEN," I SAY,
AND EISEN ROLLS +DYNAMIC. 8, SO THEY ARE DRAWN TO EISEN'S SOURCE. "'WOW,
THIS IS GREAT. WHO'S IT BY?' ASKS HECTOR, REACHING FOR YOUR PHONE."
EISEN LETS THEM HAVE IT, AND I SAY, "THEY LOOK AT THE SCREEN FOR A
MOMENT, THEN CLOSE THEIR EYES, REALLY GETTING INTO THE MUSIC.
ABSENT-MINDEDLY, THEY GO TO PUT THE PHONE INTO THEIR POCKET." I'M
**SETTING UP A FUTURE PROBLEM**, WHICH WILL TURN INTO **TAKE AWAY
SOMETHING THEY EXPECT TO HAVE** IF IT ISN'T HANDLED. "WHAT DO YOU DO,
ZURI?"

ZURI'S PLAYER SMIRKS. "YOU KNOW, EISEN, MAGIC REQUIRES SACRIFICE...." AS
EISEN SPUTTERS, I NOTICE THAT THIS, TOO, TRIGGERED A MOVE, AND SAY "IT
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE **ASSERTING YOUR PARADIGM OVER ANOTHER MAGE**." ZURI
AND EISEN'S PLAYERS BOTH GO WIDE-EYED, BUT AGREE. ZURI'S PLAYER ROLLS
+STATIC, AND GETS A 7, SO HOLDS 1. EISEN'S PLAYER SAYS, "I DON'T THINK
I'M CONVINCED. I HOLD OUT MY HAND AND ASK FOR MY PHONE BACK." I LOOK
OVER THE MOVES, AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET A SLEEPER TO DO WHAT THEY
WANT, SO IT WOULD TRIGGER THE **USE A SLEEPER** MOVE. "IN ORDER TO USE A
SLEEPER, YOU'LL NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING THEY WANT. WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING,
EISEN?" "HMM. OK, I SAY, 'HEY, HECTOR, I NEED THAT BACK NOW, BUT I'LL
SEND YOU THE PLAYLIST LATER, OK?' IS THIS WHERE I ROLL?"

ZURI'S PLAYER JUMPS IN. "ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M GOING TO SPEND MY HOLD TO
GIVE A -1 TO THAT ROLL, BECAUSE I DID *JUST* SAY THAT MAGIC REQUIRES
SACRIFICE." "IT'S TRUE, YOU DID," I SAY. "ALRIGHT, ROLL +WITHOUT MINUS
ONE." "THAT ZURI, SO CONVINCING," REMARKS EISEN'S PLAYER, AS THEY START
TO ROLL. "10! NO, WAIT, MINUS ONE, IT'S A 9. CURSE YOUR SILVER TONGUE."

"ALRIGHT, SO HECTOR WILL NEED PROOF THAT THEY'LL GET WHAT THEY WANT, OR
WILL NEED IT BEFORE THEY DO ANYTHING FOR YOU, SO I THINK HECTOR SHAKES
HIS HEAD. 'NAH, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I REALLY NEED THIS RIGHT NOW. I'M
JUST GONNA AIRDROP IT OVER TO MY PHONE..." EISEN'S PLAYER JUST KIND OF
SHRUGS, SO I SAY, "YOU REALIZE THAT IF HECTOR DOES THAT, THIS PLAYLIST
WON'T BE 'NEW' ANYMORE. IT WILL STOP FEEDING YOUR INSPIRATION. YOU WERE
SURE YOU WERE GOING TO GET ANOTHER DAY OR TWO OUT OF THIS AT LEAST." I'M
**TELLING THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND ASKING**. EISEN LETS OUT A
LONG-SUFFERING SIGH. "OK, SURE. HANG ON, WHILE MY SOURCE IS STILL KIND
OF PRESENT, AT LEAST FOR HECTOR, CAN I SPEND ONE OF MY HOLD TO BRING THE
POSITIVE TAG INTO PLAY? IT'S +INVIGORATING, SO MAYBE IT BREAKS HECTOR
OUT OF THEIR ENCHANTMENT?" I NOD, AND NOW EISEN'S PLAYER GETS TO NARRATE
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE MOMENT. THEY SAY, "SO AS THE MUSIC SWELLS, IT
STARTS TO GIVE HECTOR A RUSH OF ENERGY, AND THEN CLARITY. FINALLY, THE
MUSIC HITS AND HOLDS A SINGLE NOTE, THAT RESONATES LIKE A TUNING FORK
AND THEN SHATTERS THE ENCHANTMENT." "GREAT!" I CONTINUE. "HECTOR SHAKES
HIS HEAD TO CLEAR IT AND LOOKS AROUND. 'ZURI? WHEN DID YOU GET HERE? I
THINK SOMEONE DANGEROUS HAS BEEN LURKING AROUND!'"

THE FIRST SESSION
=================

BEFORE THE FIRST SESSION
------------------------

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS NEEDED FOR PLAY. A PRINTOUT OF EACH
OF THE PLAYBOOKS, A FEW COPIES OF THE BASIC MOVES SHEET, AN MC SHEET, A
COPY OF THE FORCES SHEET, AS WELL AS THE INTERNAL FORCES AND CONSENSUS
FORCES SHEET. READ THROUGH THE PLAYBOOKS AND BASIC MOVES IF YOU HAVEN'T
ALREADY, THEY FORM THE CORE OF THE GAME. YOU'LL ALSO NEED A COUPLE OF
DICE. THE ONES WITH SIX SIDES AND PIPS. OR NUMBERS IF YOU PREFER. READ
THROUGH THIS WHOLE BOOK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEMORIZE IT, BUT AT LEAST
SKIM THE PARTS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CHARACTER PLAYBOOKS, AND READ THE
REST WITH AS MUCH ATTENTION AS YOU CAN SPARE. YOU'LL WANT TO FAMILIARIZE
YOURSELF WITH THE PROCESS OF CREATING FORCES, BUT DO NOT BEGIN TO CREATE
THEM. NOT EVEN ONE.YOU CAN ALSO START TO COME UP WITH SOME IDEAS FOR
FANTASTIC IMAGERY TO USE, SETTINGS, THEMES, DESCRIPTIONS AND THE LIKE,
BUT DON'T COMMIT YOURSELF TO ANY PLOT, STORYLINE, OR EVEN MAKE ANY
CHARACTERS BEFORE THE GAME. YOU'LL SEE WHY AS YOU START TO PLAY, THIS IS
A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT, AND THE GAME IS SO MUCH MORE FUN WHEN YOU CAN
TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND RUN WITH THEM.

CHARACTER CREATION
------------------

### INITIAL EXPECTATIONS AND SAFETY RULES

THIS IS A GAME CENTERED AROUND HUMANS WITH MAGICAL ABILITIES, CALLED
MAGES. IT IS SET IN MODERN, OR AT LEAST SEMI-MODERN, TIMES, IN A WORLD
THAT LOOKS MORE OR LESS LIKE OUR OWN, AT LEAST TO ORDINARY PEOPLE. IT IS
MEANT TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS OF HUMANITY. IT WILL NOT GLORIFY VIOLENCE,
HAVING POWER OVER YOUR FELLOW HUMANS, OR EXCLUSIONARY RHETORIC. WE GET
ENOUGH OF THAT IN THE DEFAULT REALITY, AND MAGES ARE DRAWN FROM
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AS A GENERAL RULE, NOT FROM THOSE WHO ALREADY
HAVE THE MOST POWER.

ROLEPLAYING INVOLVES VULNERABILITY, AND ANY GAME SET IN FAMILIAR TIMES
AND DEALING WITH PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS CAN EASILY BRING UP TOPICS THAT
MAY MAKE SOME PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE OR EVEN UNWELCOME. WE VERY MUCH WANT
TO SUPPORT THE USE OF THE GAME TO EXPLORE PERSONAL ISSUES, BUT NEVER AT
THE EXPENSE OF THE PLAYERS' WELLBEING. THUS, BEFORE EVEN LOOKING AT THE
CHARACTERS, HERE ARE SOME RULES TO FOLLOW THROUGHOUT THE GAME TO HELP
EVERYONE PUSH THEMSELVES EXACTLY AS FAR AS THEY WANT TO GO, BUT NO
FARTHER.

#### DISCUSS AND ALIGN THEMES

THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TALK ABOUT THEMES AS A TABLE. FIND OUT WHAT
YOU ALL ARE INTERESTED IN PLAYING FOR. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXHAUSTIVE,
BUT THIS IS THE TIME TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOU'RE AIMING FOR A GAME WITH A
LOT OF ROMANCE AND SCHEMING, OR A LOT OF HARD LOOKS AT INEQUALITY, OR
PEERING INTO HORRORS BEYOND COMPREHENSION. DON'T HOLD THINGS IN RESERVE
HERE. LEARNING WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTS SO YOU CAN SPRING A SURPRISE GENRE
SHIFT ON THEM NOT ONLY DAMAGES TRUST, IT WON'T WORK VERY WELL IN A WORLD
WHERE MAGES REALLY CAN SHAPE REALITY. BE FORTHCOMING WITH THE TRUTH.
THIS WON'T HAVE TO LIMIT YOU. IF YOU WANT TO SEE MAGES HAVE TO DEAL AS
THEY UNCOVER ONE TERRIFYING SECRET AFTER ANOTHER, TELL THE TABLE THAT.
IF THAT EXCITES THEM AS MUCH AS IT DOES YOU, IT CAN BE A GREAT BASIS.
DON'T FORGET THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE COMING UP WITH THOSE SECRETS YET,
THOUGH.

PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THAT PLAYERS SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO
SEE. DON'T PUSH THEM ON IT, EITHER, JUST BE SURE THAT YOU'LL BE STEERING
AWAY FROM THOSE TOPICS. NOTE THAT THESE WON'T NECESSARILY BE AS SIMPLE
AS PARTICULAR TOPICS. "I DON'T WANT THE GAME TO BE ABOUT FAERIES" IS
FINE, BUT SO IS "I DON'T WANT TO PLAY A CHARACTER WHO IS ABANDONED BY
OTHERS."

#### EXPLICIT SAFETY MECHANICS

BECAUSE OF THE VULNERABILITY INHERENT IN ROLEPLAYING, AND ROLEPLAYING
POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT THEMES, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE SOME FORM OF
EXPLICIT SAFETY MECHANIC AT YOUR TABLE. THERE ARE MANY AVAILABLE, AND WE
HAVE INCLUDED A SAMPLE OF THEM HERE, ONES THAT WE'VE FOUND WORK WELL FOR
CONSENSUS. IF YOU HAVE A FAVORITE SAFETY MECHANIC, WE HIGHLY ENCOURAGE
YOU TO BRING IT WITH YOU TO THIS GAME.

##### THE X CARD

###### CREDIT FOR THIS MECHANIC GOES TO JOHN STAVROPOULOS

GIVE EVERY PLAYER AN INDEX CARD WITH A LARGE, CLEAR 'X' ON IT. EXPLAIN
THAT AT ANY TIME, ANY PLAYER MAY RAISE OR CLEARLY TAP THEIR X CARD. IF
THIS HAPPENS, WE IMMEDIATELY EDIT OUT WHATEVER WAS X-CARDED. NO
EXPLANATION OF WHY IS NECESSARY, OR SHOULD BE REQUESTED. IF THERE IS AN
ISSUE, ANYONE CAN CALL FOR A BREAK TO DISCUSS IT PRIVATELY.

THIS ENSURES THAT EVERYONE AT THE TABLE REMAINS IN CONTROL OF WHAT THEY
WILL BE EXPOSED TO, WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGURE OUT AND LIST HARD LINES
AHEAD OF TIME.

##### \[DIAL IT UP/DOWN?\]

\[LIKELY SOME FORM OF THESE WOULD BE USEFUL\]

### MAGIC

CONSENSUS IS FAIRLY FLEXIBLE IN THE TYPE OF MAGIC IT SHOWCASES, BUT
THERE ARE SOME STARTING POINTS TO KNOW SO YOU'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.
SMALL, SUBTLE MAGIC IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO MOST MAGES. MAGIC DOES NOT
INHERENTLY CARRY A COST, WE DON'T TRACK A MANA POOL THAT DETERMINES WHAT
SPELLS WE CAN CAST, AND SO EFFECTS WHICH ARE LIKELY ONLY NOTICED BY THE
MAGE IN QUESTION MAY BE PRODUCED AT ALMOST ANY TIME. LARGER EFFECTS,
MORE IN LINE WITH ADVANCED BUT STILL MODERN TECHNOLOGY, ARE ACHIEVABLE
WITH EFFORT AND HELP, OR WITH PRACTICE. TECHNICALLY, THERE IS NO TRUE
LIMIT TO WHAT A DETERMINED MAGE CAN ACHIEVE, BUT THEIR ACHIEVEMENT MAY
BE TEMPERED BY A GREAT MANY CAVEATS. REALITY HAS WAYS OF REIGNING IN
OBVIOUS MAGIC, SUCH THAT THIS IS NOT A GAME WHERE YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE
MAGES CASUALLY FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, BEING POINTED UP AT BY CURIOUS
BYSTANDERS. BUT, A MAGE'S LIFE WILL BE FULL OF MAGIC, BOTH THEIR OWN AND
OTHER PEOPLE'S, AND IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR PROBLEMS,
CAUSE SOME OTHER PROBLEMS, BUT NEVER TRULY MAKE THEM ALL GO AWAY.

### INTRODUCE PLAYBOOKS

MAKE THE PLAYBOOKS AVAILABLE, LAYING THEM ALL ON THE TABLE OR HANDING
SOME OUT TO EACH PLAYER TO BE PASSED AROUND. IN ADDITION, READ THESE
SHORT INTROS, UNLESS EVERYONE ALREADY SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

**THE CABALIST** HAS A GROUP OF MAGES WITH A SIMILAR PARADIGM TO THEIR
OWN, THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE LEADER OF. IF YOU WANT TO BE PART
OF A GROUP, OR HAVE OTHER MAGES TO WORK WITH REGULARLY, PLAY A CABALIST.
WARNING: A LOT OF YOUR POWER IS IN YOUR CABAL, AND THAT MEANS LOTS OF
DRAMA TRYING TO WRANGLE THEM.

**THE GURU **IS A TEACHER FOR A GROUP OF NON-MAGICAL STUDENTS. IF YOU
WANT TO BE EXPLICITLY IN CHARGE OF A GROUP OF SLEEPERS, YOU WANT TO PLAY
A GURU. WARNING: THIS PLAYBOOK IS QUITE REACTIVE UNTIL YOU GET TO
ADVANCED MOVES. YOU MAY BE BORED IF YOU DON'T MAKE YOUR WAY THERE
EVENTUALLY.

**THE HEDGE MAGE** IS FLEXIBLE IN THEIR MAGIC, THEY HAVE A LOT OF
OPTIONS, AND FEEL THE MOST LIKE A CLASSIC WIZARD. WARNING: THE HEDGE
MAGE IS ECLECTIC AND DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC FOCUS OR NICHE, AND IT CAN
BE HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO BE DOING AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

**THE INSPIRED** CAN HAVE BOTH VERY PERSONAL CONNECTIONS AND LARGE
REACHING MOMENTS WHERE THEY BRING MAGIC TO SLEEPERS. THEY ARE EXTREMELY
POWERFUL WHEN INTERACTING WITH THEIR SOURCE. WARNING: THEIR SOURCE IS A
CONSTANT SOURCE OF TENSION, AND MAGICALLY THEY CAN BE STYMIED WITHOUT
IF. IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO HAVE YOUR MAGIC RENDERED USELESS OR
IMPOSSIBLE ON A SOMEWHAT REGULAR BASIS, YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO PLAY
AN INSPIRED.

**THE PIOUS **HAS A VISION FOR HOW THINGS SHOULD BE, AND GOALS, AND ARE
READY TO SEE THEM THROUGH. A PIOUS IS OFTEN A VERY DRIVEN CHARACTER.
WARNING: IT'S EASY TO TRY ESCHEW CONNECTIONS AND TRY TO GO IT ALONE AS A
PIOUS, BUT NO MAGE SURVIVES WITHOUT CONNECTIONS TO THE WORLD AROUND
THEM. MAKE SURE TO KEEP CONNECTED TO AT LEAST YOUR ANCHORS.

**THE PRIMORDIAL** CUTS RIGHT THROUGH THE TRAPPINGS THAT ARE COMMON IN
MAGIC TO DEAL WITH FUNDAMENTAL FORCES AND ENERGIES. THEY HAVE THE
CAPABILITY FOR TREMENDOUS SAVAGERY. WARNING: THE PRIMORDIAL HAS A LOT OF
PRESSURE TO SOLVE ALL THEIR PROBLEMS WITH MAGIC, BUT DOING THIS WILL
EVENTUALLY CATCH UP WITH YOU, HARD.

**THE TECH ADEPT** USES MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY FLUENTLY, WHETHER THAT
MEANS MAKING INVENTIONS THAT ARE ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEIR HANDS DID
IT OR ENCHANTING COMMON TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR OWN ENDS. WARNING: THE TECH
ADEPT'S BELIEF IN HOW MAGIC FITS INTO TECHNOLOGY LIMITS THEM. IF YOU
WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO MAGIC WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY AROUND, DON'T PLAY A TECH
ADEPT.

**THE VOICED **EXEMPLIFIES EVERYTHING ABOUT THE POWER OF THE HUMAN
VOICE, FROM CONVINCING TO LEADING TO SPREADING WISDOM. SOME OF THEIR
ABILITIES ARE SUBTLE, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE NOT INCREDIBLY
POWERFUL. WARNING: THE VOICED IS ONE OF THE MOST SOCIAL PLAYBOOKS. THEY
CAN'T DO MUCH WITHOUT SOMEONE TO LISTEN TO THEM.

**THE WAYFARER** IS A TRAVELER, WANDERER, EVEN LONER, AND THEIR MAGIC
REFLECTS THIS UNBOUNDED NATURE. THE NATURE OF EACH WAYFARER'S TRAVEL IS
UNIQUE, AND PRESENTS THEM WITH UNIQUE OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
WARNING: THE WAYFARER IS AT THEIR MOST POWERFUL WHEN THEY ARE CONSTANTLY
ON THE MOVE. DON'T PLAY A WAYFARER IF YOU WANT TO SETTLE DOWN.

FOR PLAYERS WHO ARE UNSURE OF WHAT PLAYBOOK THEY WANT TO CHOOSE, FIND
OUT WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR TO BETTER UNDERSTAND A CHARACTER, AND USE
THAT TO DIRECT THEIR ATTENTION.

IF THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT OPTIONS THEY'LL HAVE, THE MOVES ARE A GOOD
PLACE TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE CHARACTER MIGHT DO AND WHAT SITUATIONS
THEY MIGHT EXCEL IN.

IF THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF MAGIC THEY'LL BE DOING, THE PARADIGMS
ARE BEST.

IF THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS THEY'LL HAVE WITH
OTHERS, HAVE THEM LOOK TO THE ANCHORS, IN ADDITION TO THE CABALIST AND
MENTOR IN PARTICULAR. THE INSPIRED AND VOICED MIGHT ALSO CATCH THEIR
ATTENTION.

IF THEY KNOW WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER THEY WANT TO PLAY IN THE ABSTRACT,
BUT DON'T KNOW WHICH PLAYBOOK CAN REPRESENT IT, THEN PARADIGM AND MOVES
ARE LIKELY TO HELP. THEY ALSO MAY FIND THEMSELVES PUSHING AGAINST THE
OPTIONS MORE THAN OTHER PLAYERS. BE FLEXIBLE.

IF THEY WANT TO BE SURE THEY PLAY A CHARACTER WHO IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL
TO THE GROUP, AND CARE ABOUT CHOOSING ONE WITH GOOD STATS, DO YOUR BEST
TO LET THEM DOWN GENTLY: THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF GAME WHERE THOSE ARE
PRIMARY WORRIES. MAGES ARE COMPETENT PEOPLE, AND THE GROUP WILL OFTEN
NOT BE FOCUSED ON THE SAME GOALS ANYWAY. ENCOURAGE THEM TO CHOOSE A
PLAYBOOK THEY FIND INTERESTING, BECAUSE OF WHO IT SUGGESTS BEING, NOT
JUST WHAT IT CAN DO.

ONCE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR PLAYBOOKS, THEY CAN START GOING THROUGH AND
SELECTING OPTIONS AND FILLING IN BLANKS. THE MC, AS LIKELY THE ONE WHO
HAS READ THIS BOOK THE MOST, CAN HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS AS THEY GET
STARTED.

### STATS

THE STATS ARE:

-   **STATIC**: AS IN UNMOVABLE, STEADY, SET IN YOUR WAYS, AND
    CONSERVATIVE.
-   **DYNAMIC**: AS IN CREATIVE, FREE-FLOWING, ADAPTABLE, EASILY MOVED,
    AND INVENTIVE.
-   **ENTROPIC**: AS IN DIRECT, ACTIVE, UNSTOPPABLE, FORWARD, AND
    DESTRUCTIVE.
-   **WITHIN**: REFERRING TO THE INTERNAL SELF, CONTROLLED REACTIONS,
    ABILITY TO INTROSPECT, AND KNOW YOURSELF.
-   **WITHOUT**: REFERRING TO THE EXTERNAL WORLD, CONNECTIONS, EMPATHY
    AND UNDERSTANDING.

STATS CAN NEVER BE HIGHER THAN +3, AND MOST WILL RANGE FROM -1 TO +2.

### SETTING EXPECTATIONS

WHILE THE PLAYERS START MAKING CHARACTERS, THE MC WILL BE ANSWERING
QUESTIONS AS THEY COME UP, AND IN BETWEEN THAT SHOULD BE SETTING
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE GAME TO COME. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE THINGS
WE SUGGEST GETTING OUT IN FRONT OF.

-   YOUR CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE TO BE FRIENDS, BUT AT THE TIME THE GAME
    STARTS THEY SHOULD ALL KNOW EACH OTHER, AND SHOULD BE BASICALLY
    ALLIES AND NOT ENEMIES, EVEN IF THEY HAVE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS.
    CHARACTERS CAN BECOME ENEMIES DURING PLAY, BUT SHOULD START OUT ON
    AT LEAST CIVIL TERMS. THESE MAGES ARE NOTABLY AND NOTICEABLY
    DIFFERENT FROM THE UNAWAKENED MASSES, SO THEY WILL HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY
    NOTICED EACH OTHER.

-   YOUR CHARACTERS ARE UNIQUE IN THE WORLD OF CONSENSUS. THERE MIGHT BE
    OTHER MAGES WHO TAKE APPROACHES FROM MANY SCHOOLS, BUT YOU'RE THE
    ONLY HEDGE MAGE. THERE MIGHT BE (PROBABLY ARE) OTHER MAGES WHO WORK
    TOGETHER AND SHARE SIMILAR OUTLOOKS AND PARADIGMS, BUT YOU'RE THE
    ONLY CABALIST.

-   ALL OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE PREPARATIONS, WHICH REPRESENT THE BASIC
    PROTECTIONS YOU TAKE AGAINST HARM, MAGICAL OR MUNDANE. THIS MEANS
    YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A LOT OF GAME TIME FOR YOUR CHARACTERS TO
    TAKE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS BEFORE GOING OUT. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT THEY
    LOOK LIKE, AND IF THEY CHANGE AT ANY POINT. YOU CAN REGAIN
    PREPARATIONS BY SPENDING A FEW MINUTES IN RELATIVE SAFETY CONNECTING
    WITH AN ANCHOR.

-   RENDING MAGIC IS POWERFUL, IT JUST WORKS, AND IS EXTREMELY
    DANGEROUS. YOU CAN DESCRIBE A RENDING EFFECT, AND IT HAPPENS, BUT
    SHOULD IT EVEN TANGENTIALLY AFFECT A LOOKOUT, BE PREPARED FOR
    REALITY TO HIT YOU BACK HARD. IT'S EASY TO THINK THIS WILL BE THE
    SOLUTION, BUT IT RARELY SOLVES MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT CREATES.
    RENDING MAGIC, BY ITS VERY DEFINITION, CANNOT COEXIST WITH
    CONSENSUAL REALITY. BEFORE LONG, ONE OF THEM WILL HAVE TO GIVE, AND
    THAT ONE IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE RENDING MAGIC.

-   NOTICE YOUR SAVINGS AND OTHER GEAR, THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR CHARACTER
    CAME INTO THAT GEAR, AND WHAT IT MEANS TO THEM.

-   YOU ALL HAVE ANCHORS, WHICH ARE NON-MAGICAL PARTS OF YOUR LIVES.
    THEY SERVE THE DUAL ROLES OF KEEPING YOU CONNECTED TO YOUR HUMANITY,
    AND HOLDING YOU BACK FROM WHAT YOU COULD PERHAPS BECOME. ANCHORS
    COME UP DAY-TO-DAY BY HELPING YOU RECHARGE, AND ALSO WHEN THEY ARE
    THREATENED. LOSING AN ANCHOR ALMOST ALWAYS HURTS.

-   THE MC ISN'T OUT TO GET YOU, AND ISN'T YOUR ADVERSARY. IF THEY WERE,
    THEY COULD JUST INTRODUCE ANGRY SPIRITS THAT RIP OUT YOUR CHARACTERS
    SOULS SO THEY DIE. THE END. THAT'S NO FUN FOR ANYONE. SIMILARLY,
    THEY AREN'T THERE TO MAKE YOU GUESS WHAT THEY'RE THINKING, OR FEEL
    SMART BY PRESENTING PUZZLES THAT PROVE THE PLAYERS CAN'T READ THEIR
    MIND. THE MC AND THE PLAYERS ARE BOTH THERE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING
    TO HAPPEN TO THE MAGES.

### INTRODUCTIONS

ONCE EVERYONE HAS THE BASICS OF THEIR CHARACTERS DECIDED, GO AROUND THE
TABLE AND HAVE EVERYONE INTRODUCE THEIR CHARACTERS. START WITH NAME AND
PRONOUNS, AND MOVE ON TO MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS.

#### PARADIGM

SHARING A CHARACTER'S PARADIGM GIVES THE STARTING POINT OF WHO THEY ARE
AS A MAGE. IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK AT THE WORLD AND WHAT
KIND OF MAGIC TO EXPECT FROM THEM, BUT ALSO WHAT THEY CAN'T WORK WITH.
CHARACTERS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE TO WORK AROUND EACH OTHERS' OPPOSED
ASPECTS A LOT, SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO WHAT THEY ARE.

#### LOOKS

TALK ABOUT WHAT THE CHARACTER LOOKS LIKE, USING THE TRAITS ON THE
CHARACTER SHEET AS GUIDES. SINCE MAGES USUALLY HAVE MORE THAN JUST THE
FIVE SENSES, AURA IS A NOTEWORTHY PART OF ANY MAGE'S DESCRIPTION.

#### PREPARATIONS

THIS IS ONE ELEMENT THAT CAN BE SKIPPED IF THE THEMES OF THE GAME
SUGGEST IT WON'T BE RELEVANT ANY TIME SOON. BUT, DESCRIBING THE
PREPARATIONS GIVES A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF HOW THE MAGE'S PARADIGM
FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS WHAT THEY ARE LIKELY TO LOOK LIKE IF THEY DO END
UP IN DANGER.

AS EVERYONE INTRODUCES THEIR CHARACTERS, PEOPLE WILL LIKELY START TO
SUGGEST IDEAS ABOUT HOW THEY COULD BE CONNECTED, OR INVOLVED WITH PIECES
OF THE WORLD THAT ARE BROUGHT UP. THAT'S GREAT! TRY NOT TO GET TOO
BOGGED DOWN WITH IT, BUT THESE CONNECTIONS HELP BUILD THE WORLD THE
CHARACTERS WILL INHABIT.

### THE THREE QUESTIONS

THE MC WILL WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO EACH OF THE THREE QUESTIONS ON
YOUR PLAYBOOK, "WHY WAS YOUR HUMANITY TRIVIALIZED?" "WHY IS YOUR
HUMANITY STILL IN QUESTION?" "WHY ARE YOU HUNTED?" THIS MIGHT REQUIRE A
LITTLE BIT OF NEGOTIATION TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE
ABOUT WHAT THESE QUESTIONS MEAN AND WHAT THE ANSWERS MEAN. THE MC SHOULD
ASK A FEW PROBING OR LEADING QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE, IN ORDER TO
UNDERSTAND THEM AND START TO CONNECT THEM TO THE WORLD, BUT DON'T GO TOO
FAR HERE, LEAVE THINGS UNEXPLORED AND OPEN TO CHANGING, BECAUSE THE
FIRST SCENES OF THE GAME WILL FILL OUT EXACTLY HOW THESE CONNECT THE
CHARACTERS TO THE WORLD.

### ANCHORS

AS THE CHARACTERS BECOME READY, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR ANCHORS. THIS IS
KEY TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT MOTIVATES THE CHARACTERS AND TO REVEALING THE
WORLD AROUND THEM. FIND OUT WHAT THE ANCHORS ARE, AND NOTE THIS ON YOUR
SUMMARY SHEET. THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW ARE HOW THEY KEEP THE
CHARACTER ANCHORED, THAT IS, CONNECTED TO THE MUNDANE AND PHYSICAL
WORLD, AND WHAT COMMON WAYS FOR THAT CONNECTION TO DEGRADE ARE. FOR SOME
CASES, THIS MIGHT BE EASY. A SHELTER ANCHOR THAT IS THE MAGE'S HOUSE
KEEPS THEM CONNECTED BY BEING A HOME, AND IT CAN DEGRADE BY THE RENT
COMING DUE, HOUSEWORK BUILDING UP, PIPES BURSTING, AND SO ON. OTHER
ANCHORS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT. WHETHER CLEAR OR NOT, ASK A FEW DETAILED
QUESTIONS ABOUT EACH ANCHOR, TO MAKE THE PLAYER MAKE UP SOME ANSWERS.
ASK WHERE IT CAME FROM, WHAT A RELATIVE THINKS OF THE ANCHOR, WHY THIS
IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT, AND SO ON. DON'T GET TOO DEEP, SINCE THERE WILL BE
TIME FOR THAT LATER, BUT SEEK TO HAVE A CLEAR STARTING POINT.

### FLAGS

EACH CHARACTER NEEDS A FLAG, WHICH IS A WAY THAT THE PLAYER THINKS IT
WOULD BE INTERESTING FOR OTHER CHARACTERS TO INTERACT WITH THEM. FOR
EXAMPLE, PIPER'S PLAYER SAYS THAT SHE WANTS TO SEE PIPER BECOME MORE OF
A LEADER OF THE MAGES, SO SHE SETS HER FLAG AS "ACQUIESCE TO MY
AUTHORITY". OTHERS MIGHT INCLUDE "MAKE ME LOOK AFTER MYSELF, TOO" OR
"ASK FOR MY ADVICE". OTHER CHARACTERS WILL GAIN EXPERIENCE FOR HITTING
THESE FLAGS, AS AN INCENTIVE FOR THE PLAYERS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. RECORD
THESE FLAGS IN A TABLE WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE THEM AND KNOW WHICH
CHARACTERS HAVE ALREADY HIT WHICH FLAGS.

HAVE EVERYONE DECLARE THEIR FIRST FLAGS AND WRITE THEM IN A SHARED,
VISIBLE PLACE. THESE FLAGS WILL HELP THE PLAYERS TELL EACH OTHER WHAT
KINDS OF EARLY INTERACTIONS THEY ARE EXPECTING AND HOPING FOR, AS WELL
AS A CHANCE TO START GAINING EXPERIENCE RIGHT AWAY. BECAUSE THE MAGES
ARE NEW TO THE GAME, IT'S LIKELY THEY WILL BE SIMPLE, AND MAY EVEN BE
BASED ON THINGS THAT THE PLAYERS EXPECT TO BECOME QUITE COMMON. FOR THE
FIRST SESSION, THEY SHOULD BE OBVIOUS, PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS AND SET
EXPECTATIONS, RATHER THAN TRYING TO SUBVERT EXPECTATIONS THAT THE TABLE
HASN'T SEEN ESTABLISHED YET. FOR EXAMPLE, IF LAZARUS' PLAYER WANTS TO
ESTABLISH THAT HE'S TRUSTING TO A FAULT, HE MIGHT SAY TO THE TABLE
"LAZARUS IS PRETTY GULLIBLE, SO MY FIRST FLAG IS 'TELL ME A LIE THAT I
BELIEVE'. IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD TO MAKE HIM BELIEVE."

FIRST SCENES
------------

ONCE CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN CREATED, IT'S TIME TO PLAY THROUGH THE FIRST
SCENES IN THE GAME. IN CONSENSUS, THE FIRST SCENES WE PLAY THROUGH ARE
RELATED TO THE THREE QUESTIONS THAT EVERY CHARACTER ANSWERS DURING
CHARACTER CREATION. THROUGH THIS WE'LL ESTABLISH SOME SHARED HISTORY
BETWEEN CHARACTERS, SOME CURRENT TIES, AND WE'LL FORESHADOW FUTURE
PROBLEMS AND COMPLICATIONS. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE
AVAILABLE, YOU SHOULD AIM FOR BETWEEN 3 AND 6 SCENES FOR THIS PART,
WHICH EXPLORE THE ANSWERS TO THOSE THREE QUESTIONS FOR MULTIPLE
CHARACTERS. MAKE SURE EACH CHARACTER IS A PART OF AT LEAST ONE SCENE,
PREFERABLY 2 OR MORE THAT EXPLORE ANSWERS TO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. ALSO
MAKE SURE EACH QUESTION IS THE FOCUS OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE SCENES.

THESE ARE THE FIRST SCENES YOU WILL BE PLAYING, SO IF YOU SEE THE CHANCE
TO HAVE A MOVE TRIGGER, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE IT! THESE CAN BE A GREAT
INTRODUCTION TO THE MECHANICS AS WELL AS TO OUR CHARACTERS AND THE
WORLD.

### PULLING IN MULTIPLE CHARACTERS

WHEN THE PLAYERS GO AROUND INTRODUCING THEIR CHARACTERS, MAKE A NOTE OF
ANY ANSWERS TO THE 3 QUESTIONS (OR LEADING QUESTIONS YOU POSE ABOUT
THOSE QUESTIONS) THAT SEEM TO SYNCHRONIZE WITH EACH OTHER. YOU'LL USE
THIS TO SET THOSE CHARACTERS UP IN THE SAME SCENE AND START IT OFF IN A
WAY THAT LETS YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS AND THE WORLD THEY ARE
INTERACTING WITH. IF YOU HAVE 4 PLAYERS AND ARE AIMING FOR 4 SCENES, YOU
COULD MAKE EACH SCENE HAVE TWO CHARACTERS IN IT, OR YOU COULD PULL ALL 4
CHARACTERS INTO THE SCENE ABOUT THE FIRST QUESTION, AND GIVE EACH
CHARACTER AN INDIVIDUAL SCENE THAT ADDRESSES ONE OF THE OTHERS. DURING
EACH SCENE YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR PLACES WHERE THE ACTIONS THEY DESCRIBE
WOULD TRIGGER A MOVE, AND HAVE THEM ROLL IT.

### FRAMING A SCENE

DURING THE FIRST SESSION, YOUR METHOD OF CHOOSING SCENES IS A BIT MORE
STRUCTURED AND FORMULAIC THAN IT WILL BE IN FUTURE SESSIONS. FIRST,
CHOOSE ONE OF THE 3 QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLORE. THESE OFTEN
MAKE THE MOST SENSE IF THEY GO IN ORDER, SO ANY SCENES ABOUT THE FIRST
QUESTION BEFORE SCENES ABOUT THE SECOND AND SO ON, BUT THAT ISN'T ALWAYS
THE CASE. NEXT, PICK ANY NUMBER OF MAGES WHO HAVE ANSWERS TO THAT
QUESTION THAT COULD SYNERGIZE. PUT THEM INTO A SITUATION THAT STARTS TO
EXPLORE THEIR ANSWERS, AND THEN START ASKING LEADING QUESTIONS TO PROBE
DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THEIR ANSWERS. FIND OUT WHO TRIVIALIZED THEIR
HUMANITY, OR HOW IT LEAD THEM TO A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PARADIGM
ABOUT THE WORLD, OR WHAT THEY MOST FEAR ABOUT BEING HUNTED. FIND OUT
ANYTHING YOU CAN WHILE PLAYING OUT THE SCENE, AND HELP THE CHARACTERS
ESTABLISH THEIR TIES AND CONNECTIONS TO EACH OTHER WHILE DOING IT. ALSO
LOOK FOR PLACES WHERE CHARACTERS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO ONE MAGE MIGHT
ALSO BE CONNECTED TO ANOTHER, AND HOW BOTH MAGES MIGHT WANT DIFFERENT
AND COMPETING THINGS FROM THAT NON-PLAYER CHARACTER.IF YOU'VE CHOSEN THE
FIRST QUESTION, IT'S LIKELY YOU'LL WANT TO FRAME IT AS A FLASHBACK. FEEL
FREE TO DESCRIBE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND CAMERA SHOTS, FOG CLOUDING PEOPLE'S
MEMORIES AND CHEESY FLASHBACK CHIMES. FRAME A SCENE THAT EXPLORES THE
CHARACTERS' HUMANITY BEING TRIVIALIZED.

IF YOU'VE CHOSEN THE SECOND QUESTION, YOU WILL LIKELY WANT TO FRAME IT
IN THE RECENT PAST OR IN THE PRESENT. AGAIN, MAKE GOOD USE OF VISUAL
STORYTELLING TROPES LIKE CAMERA ANGLES TO ESTABLISH THE SCENE OR TONE.
FRAME A SCENE THAT QUESTIONS THE CHARACTERS' HUMANITY, FROM AN EXTERNAL
SOURCE OR EVEN AN INTERNAL ONE.

IF YOU'VE CHOSEN THE THIRD QUESTION, YOU SHOULD SET IT IN THE PRESENT,
AND YOU SHOULD MAKE IT IMMEDIATE. MAKE SOFT MOVES THAT CHARACTERS NEED
TO REACT TO WHILE ALSO ASKING LEADING QUESTIONS TO MAKE THEM FILL IN
DETAILS ABOUT THE WORLD. FRAME A SCENE THAT SHOWS THEM BEING HUNTED OR
PURSUED, OR EVIDENCE THAT THEY SOON WILL BE OR RECENTLY HAVE BEEN.

#### TURNING THE THREE QUESTIONS INTO SCENES

THE FIRST QUESTION ASKS THE PLAYER TO THINK ABOUT WHY THEIR MAGE'S
HUMANITY WAS TRIVIALIZED. THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING BEFORE THEY AWAKENED
TO THEIR POTENTIAL AS A MAGE, AND SHOULD PROVIDE A GREAT PLACE TO MINE
FOR SCENES THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE CHARACTERS' MUNDANE PASTS. IF YOU CAN,
TIE IN A CHARACTER'S ANCHORS HERE, ESPECIALLY ANY IMPORTANT PEOPLE OR
MEMORIES FROM THEIR YOUNGER DAYS.

THE SECOND QUESTION ASKS THE PLAYER TO THINK ABOUT WHY THEIR MAGE'S
HUMANITY MIGHT STILL BE IN QUESTION. AWAKENING HASN'T SOLVED ALL OF
THEIR PROBLEMS, AND THIS IS A FERTILE GROUND TO LOOK FOR SCENES THAT
INCLUDE THE CHARACTER'S CURRENT FRIENDS, TIES, RELATIONS, AND TROUBLES.
IF YOU CAN, TIE IN ANY RELEVANT ANCHORS (LIKE SHELTER), GEAR, WHAT THEY
DO DURING AN AVERAGE DAY, AND THEIR PARADIGM/MAGIC.

THE THIRD QUESTION ASKS THE PLAYER TO THINK ABOUT WHY THEY MIGHT BE
HUNTED. THIS COULD TAKE ON A POSITIVE OR A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION, SO TRY
TO GET A SENSE OF THAT BEFORE YOU FRAME THE SCENE OR EVEN DECIDE WHICH
CHARACTERS ARE GOING TO BE IN IT. GENERALLY IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO GROUP
CHARACTERS WHO FEEL POSITIVELY ABOUT BEING HUNTED WITH LIKE, AND SAME
FOR NEGATIVE, BUT LOOK FOR PLACES WHERE THAT ISN'T TRUE, AND SEE IF YOU
CAN FRAME A SCENE AROUND THAT. MAKE SURE TO ASK A LOT OF LEADING
QUESTIONS IN SCENES THAT FOCUS ON THIS QUESTION, PLAYERS WILL LIKELY
GIVE ANSWERS THAT LEAD DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOST INTERESTING FORCES.

### ASK LEADING QUESTIONS

IN ADDITION TO PLAYING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS, DURING THESE SCENES YOU
SHOULD ASK QUESTIONS THAT GET AT THINGS WHICH INTEREST YOU AND SEEM LIKE
THEY MIGHT BE USEFUL TO BUILD ON. LEADING QUESTIONS HELP ENSURE THAT THE
PLAYER WILL HAVE AN ANSWER, AND DOESN'T JUST FEEL OVERWHELMED WITH THE
NEED TO MAKE UP MORE DETAILS ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER THAN THEY KNOW. DON'T
JUST ASK "WHAT WAS SCHOOL LIKE?" INSTEAD ASK, "WHAT WAS THE NAME OF YOUR
BIGGEST BULLY IN HIGH SCHOOL? WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?" BUILD ON THE
ANSWERS, SO IF THE PLAYER ANSWERS "KEVIN JAMES, HE TOOK MY LUNCH MONEY",
MAYBE ASK WHY KEVIN SINGLED YOU OUT OVER THE REST OF YOUR CLASSMATES..
YOU'RE SEEKING ANSWERS THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP YOU CHARACTERIZE THE
MAGES, BUT ALSO DEMONSTRATE ANSWERS TO THE MAGES' THREE QUESTIONS, AND
HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR STRESSORS. YOU EVEN MAY BE ABLE TO ASK
QUESTIONS THAT START TO DEVELOP PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT MAY BE USED AS
FORCES. ASKING AN INSPIRED WHO SELLS "CHEMICALLY ASSISTED EXPERIENCES"
THE QUESTION "WHO ARE YOUR MOST RELIABLE CUSTOMERS?" MIGHT SUGGEST A
GROUP THAT COULD EASILY BECOME A FORCE.

YOU CAN SOMETIMES USE LEADING QUESTIONS TO PUSH THE WORLD IN A
PARTICULAR DIRECTION. IF YOU ASK THE HEDGE MAGE, "WHAT DID YOU OFFER TO
THE STAR CULT IN ORDER TO ENSURE YOUR HERB CHEST IS ALWAYS FULL?" YOU'RE
ESTABLISHING THAT THERE'S A STAR CULT, AND GIVING THE OPTION FOR THE
HEDGE MAGE TO BE MAKING DUBIOUS DEALS. IF YOU ADD "THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO?" TO THE END, IT BECOMES EVEN MORE POINTED.

YOU CAN GO DEEPER HERE THAN EARLIER IN CHARACTER CREATION, AS LONG AS
THE ANSWERS KEEP GIVING THE TABLE INTERESTING STUFF TO WORK WITH.

### IDENTIFYING THE STRESSOR

DURING THE FIRST SESSION, AFTER A SCENE OR WHILE A SCENE WRAPS UP, THE
MC SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE LIST OF STRESSORS, AND THINK ABOUT WHICH
ONE WAS PRIMARY IN THE SCENE THAT PLAYED OUT. IF IT ISN'T OBVIOUS, AND
IT OFTEN WILL BE, THE MC CAN ASK A COUPLE MORE LEADING QUESTIONS TO
REALLY SOLIDIFY ONE OF THE STRESSORS. EACH SCENE SHOULD HAVE ONE
STRESSOR ASSIGNED TO IT AFTER THE FACT, AND THE MC WILL USE THIS TO FILL
OUT THE WORLD BEFORE THE SECOND SESSION.

### NUMBER OF SCENES

DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE, THE NUMBER OF SCENES ARE VARIABLE.
HOWEVER, WE RECOMMEND BETWEEN 3 AND 6 BECAUSE EACH SCENE TURNS INTO A
FORCE IN THE WORLD. HAVING LESS THAN 3 WILL RESULT IN A FLAT WORLD AND
LIKELY PLAYERS WILL LOOK AT THE FORCES AS CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME. HAVING
MORE THAN 6 BECOMES VERY HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF AND KEEP UP WITH FROM
SESSION TO SESSION. THERE ARE ALREADY SO MANY SCENES THAT PLAYERS WILL
WANT TO FIT INTO THE GAME, EXTRA FORCES WILL TEND TO FALL BY THE
WAYSIDE.

ENDING A SESSION
----------------

AT THE END OF A SESSION, BEFORE WRAPPING UP AND PUTTING EVERYTHING AWAY,
THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD DO AS A TABLE. FIRST, YOU SHOULD
NOTE DOWN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE YOU ENDED, WHETHER ON A CLIFFHANGER
OR WITH SOME RESOLUTION, AND MAKE SURE TO WRITE DOWN ANY LINGERING
FORESHADOWS THAT HAVE COME UP DURING PLAY. THEN, YOU SHOULD PROCEED
THROUGH THE END OF SESSION MOVE, FOLLOWING ITS INSTRUCTIONS. FINALLY, IT
IS OFTEN GOOD FORM TO MENTION ANYTHING YOU PARTICULARLY ENJOYED FROM
ANOTHER PLAYER DURING THIS TIME.

AFTER THE FIRST SESSION
-----------------------

GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, DON'T START THIS RIGHT AFTER THE FIRST
SESSION. LET SOME IDEAS PERCOLATE THROUGH YOUR DREAMS AND SUBCONSCIOUS.
GIVE IT AT LEAST A DAY OR TWO.

NOW, TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LIST OF STRESSORS YOU GOT FROM THE SCENES IN
THE FIRST SESSION, AND PULL OUT THE NOTES YOU TOOK ABOUT THE DETAILS
THAT YOU AND THE OTHER PLAYERS ESTABLISHED ABOUT THE WORLD. GO OVER THEM
CAREFULLY AND FOLLOW THE STEPS LISTED IN THE CHAPTER ON FORCES TO CREATE
THE WORLD THAT THE CHARACTERS INHABIT. SEE WHERE THE THINGS YOU'VE
ALREADY ESTABLISHED CAN FIT IN, AND USE OTHER PARTS TO INSPIRE YOU.

WHEN THINKING OF FORCES, BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE INTERESTING THINGS TO
SAY, CHOOSE WHAT RESONATES WITH YOU. PICK THINGS THAT PUT YOU IN THE
MINDSET OF: DEEP CONNECTIONS, MAGICAL ETHICS, EVERYDAY MIRACLES, AND
THINGS THAT LURK IN SHADOWS. PICK THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO READ, OR
BINGE-WATCH. THINGS THAT MAKE YOUR MIND OVERFLOW WITH VIVID IMAGERY,
THINGS THAT MAKE YOU YEARN TO EXPLORE AND CHANGE THE WORLD.

THE SECOND SESSION AND BEYOND
-----------------------------

### STARTING A SESSION

GATHER YOUR MC SHEET, PC SUMMARY SHEET, FORCES, FLAGS, AND FORESHADOWS.
READ OUT FLAGS FOR ALL THE PLAYERS' CHARACTERS, AND NOTE WHICH ONES CAN
BE CHANGED. MARK ONE CODE OFF EVERY FORESHADOW, AND MENTION THEM AS YOU
DO SO.

HAVE EVERY PLAYER MARK ONE CODE OFF EVERY ANCHOR. IF THINGS COME TO
MIND, NOTE WHAT THESE CODES MEAN, BUT IF NOT, YOU WILL DETERMINE THAT
WHEN A CHARACTER GOES TO RECONNECT WITH THE ANCHOR. AN ANCHOR BEGINNING
TO SLIP PROBABLY DESERVES A BIT OF PROSE, THOUGH.

TAKE STOCK OF ALL THE SLIPPING STATUS TRACKS, SINCE THEY CAN EASILY
ADVANCE THIS SESSION. REVIEW ANY EFFECTS FROM THAT LAST SESSION THAT
WERE EXTENDED ONTO THIS ONE, LIKE "-1 FORWARD" OR A MOVE BEING
UNAVAILABLE.

HAVE PLAYERS WITH MOVES TRIGGERED AT THE START OF THE SESSION PERFORM
THEM. REMEMBER THE ONES THAT ROLL 6- FOR THE FIRST SCENE.

FRAME A SCENE AND MAKE A SOFT MOVE.

### FRAMING SCENES

FRAME SCENES SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE STARTING AND CAN USE
THAT AS A JUMPING-OFF POINT TO CONTRIBUTE. A SCENE SHOULD START WHEN THE
ACTION GETS INTERESTING, NOT BEFORE, SO SKIP THE PREPARATION THAT CAN BE
TAKEN FOR GRANTED (IF THE PREPARATION MIGHT BE INTERESTING, THEN MAKE IT
INTO ITS OWN SCENE, DON'T TACK IT ONTO THE FRONT OF ANOTHER.) SOMETIMES
IT WILL BE CLEAR HOW EXACTLY TO START A SCENE, BUT WHENEVER IT ISN'T,
TRY ONE OF THESE TECHNIQUES.

-   PUT TWO PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERESTING SITUATION AND ASK
    THEM WHY THEY'RE THERE. MAKE A SOFT MOVE (SO ONE THAT DEMANDS A
    RESPONSE OR ELSE IT WILL TURN INTO A HARD MOVE.) THIS CAN BE SCARY,
    BUT LET YOUR PLAYERS SURPRISE YOU!

-   POSE A QUESTION TO YOURSELF OF THE FORM "WHAT HAPPENS WHEN...?" THAT
    INVOLVES ONE OR MORE CHARACTERS AND WILL ALTER THE STORY WHEN IT IS
    ANSWERED. START THE SCENE AS CLOSE TO WHEN THE ANSWER WOULD BE
    REVEALED AS POSSIBLE.

-   PICK A PLAN A CHARACTER HAS BEEN WORKING ON, AND PLAY TO FIND OUT
    HOW THE NEXT STEP IS PREPARED OR EXECUTED, OR GOES WRONG.

-   PICK A FORCE THAT JUST HAD A STATUS TRACK ADVANCE, OR ADVANCE A
    STACK TRACK AND THEN PICK THAT FORCE. MAKE THE OUTCOME AFFECT ONE OR
    MORE OF THE MAGES, AND SHOW THEM FIRST ENCOUNTERING IT.

-   ASK HOW A CHARACTER CONNECTS WITH AN ANCHOR OR INSPIRATION.

-   LOOK AT A SLIPPING STATUS TRACK, ESPECIALLY A CHARACTER'S ANCHOR OR
    THEIR HEALTH, MARK OFF A CODE, AND FRAME A SCENE AROUND IT SLIPPING
    EVEN FURTHER.

-   HAVE AN NPC ASK ONE CHARACTER FOR HELP IN A WAY THAT WILL PUT THEM
    AT ODDS WITH ANOTHER CHARACTER.

-   ASK A LEADING QUESTION OF A CHARACTER THAT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD HAVE
    AN INTERESTING ANSWER TO PLAY OUT ("WHO SURPRISED YOU WHEN THEY
    SHOWED UP TO WORSHIP AT YOUR CHURCH THIS MORNING?"). ONLY FOLLOW UP
    IF IT SEEMS LIKELY TO GO SOMEWHERE.

WHEN FRAMING A SCENE, DEFINE WHAT IS NEEDED TO GET STARTED; THINK ABOUT
TIME, PLACE, AND WHO IS AROUND. LET OTHER DETAILS BE FILLED IN
NATURALLY. KEEP AN EYE ON WHEN THE SCENE HAS FULFILLED ITS PURPOSE, SO
IT DOESN'T BEGIN TO DRAG ON. WHEN THE MAJOR TENSION OF A SCENE HAS
RESOLVED, WHETHER THAT TENSION WAS THERE AT THE OUTSET OR AROSE WITHIN
THE SCENE, WRAP IT UP AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE. STORIES OFTEN LEAVE
YOU ON A CLIFFHANGER, AND IT CAN BE FUN TO DO THAT HERE. SOMETIMES THE
END OF THE SCENE IS LEFT UP TO THE AUDIENCE TO FILL IN WITH THEIR
IMAGINATION, THEY KNOW THE OUTCOME, BUT WHAT EXACTLY TRANSPIRED DOESN'T
NEED TO HAPPEN "ON SCREEN". FOLLOWUPS CAN EITHER BE BRIEFLY MENTIONED,
OR MADE INTO NEW SCENES OF THEIR OWN.

\newpage

STATUS TRACKS
=============

MANY THINGS IN CONSENSUS HAVE A SORT OF PROGRESSION. EVEN IF INDIVIDUAL
EVENTS AREN'T PRECISELY CONNECTED, ONE LAYERS ON TOP OF ANOTHER, GETTING
MORE AND MORE INTENSE UNTIL REACHING A BREAKING POINT.

TO REPRESENT THIS, CONSENSUS USES STATUS CODES SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN
MEDICAL TRANSPORT, RANGING FROM CODE 50 DOWN TO CODE N.

HARM AND HEALING
----------------

EVERY PLAYBOOK HAS A SECTION LABELED "HEALTH," WHICH IS THE PRIMARY
STATUS TRACK PLAYERS WILL KEEP TRACK OF FOR THEIR PCS. THESE ARE
DIRECTLY BASED OFF THE MEDICAL TRANSPORT CODES LISTED BELOW:

-   **CODE 50** BASIC TRANSPORT (NOT SERIOUS)

-   **CODE 40** SERIOUS CASE (IV STARTED)

-   **CODE 30** TRAUMA CASE

-   **CODE 20** ACUTE TRAUMA CASE

-   **CODE 10** CRITICAL TRAUMA CASE

-   **CODE N** NEWSWORTHY EVENT

NO MATTER HOW INJURED YOU ARE, IF YOU PHYSICALLY PUSH YOURSELF WHILE
INJURED, THE INJURIES MAY GET WORSE. BEING STRENUOUS WITH A CRACKED RIB
IS JUST ASKING TO END UP WITH A PUNCTURED LUNG AFTER ALL. (MCS NOTE THE
ADJUST A STATUS TRACK MOVE) THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOUR STATUS
TRACK HAS HIT (CROSSED OFF) CODE 30 OF BELOW. WE CALL THIS STATE
"SLIPPING." WHEN A STATUS TRACK IS SLIPPING, THE MC MAY ADVANCE THAT
TRACK AS A SOFT MOVE, IN RESPONSE TO THE NORMAL COURSE OF PLAY, WHERE
OTHERWISE ADVANCING A STATUS TRACK THAT IS NOT SLIPPING IS USUALLY A
HARD MOVE. FOR YOUR HEALTH TRACK THIS REPRESENTS INJURIES THAT WILL KILL
YOU WITHOUT MEDICAL ATTENTION. A PUNCTURED LUNG, A CRACKED SKULL, THE
TYPE OF THINGS IF YOU JUST TRY TO REST AND RECUPERATE WILL END UP
KILLING YOU. NOTE HOW THIS MEANS THE MORE YOU ARE INJURED, THE FASTER
YOU SLIP TOWARDS CODE N.

CODE N, AS NOTED ABOVE IS A NEWSWORTHY EVENT, WHICH MEANS SOMETHING
LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE HEADLINES (AT LEAST FOR THE NEWSPAPER OF YOUR
CHARACTER'S LIFE) HAS HAPPENED, AND IS ALMOST ALWAYS IRREVOCABLE. IN THE
CASE OF YOUR HEALTH STATUS TRACK, THIS OFTEN MEANS DEATH. IF YOU TAKE
HARM THAT WOULD PUT YOU AT CODE N FOR YOUR HEALTH TRACK, YOU ROLL THE
DEATH MOVE.

EACH TIME YOU MARK OFF A CODE OF HEALTH, YOU SHOULD WRITE AN IDEA OF
WHAT THE INJURY IS THAT CAME FROM THE HARM ON THE LINE NEXT TO THAT
CODE. FOR CODE 50, THIS COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A SPRAINED WRIST. FOR CODE
30 WE MIGHT SEE AN INJURY LIKE BLOOD LOSS OR A GUNSHOT WOUND. CODE 10 IS
OFTEN REACHED FROM A NUMBER OF COMPOUNDING OR UNTREATED INJURIES, AND
THEREFORE MIGHT NOT LOOK ON ITS OWN LIKE THE CHARACTER IS AT DEATH'S
DOOR, BUT WITH THE OTHER LISTED INJURIES, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT THEY
CAN NOT EASILY CONTINUE.

HARM FOLLOWS FROM THE FICTION. THE MC CAN USE THE FOLLOWING LEVELS OF
HARM TO REFERENCE WHEN **DEALING DAMAGE**:

-   **0 HARM **SMALL CUTS

-   **1 HARM** A SOLID PUNCH

-   **2 HARM** A KNIFE WOUND, OR ENERGY DRAIN

-   **3 HARM** A GUNSHOT

-   **4 HARM** A GRENADE, OR SOUL RENDING

SINCE ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF HARM IS TRIGGERING THE HARM MOVE,
HARM THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY LEAVE ANY LASTING EFFECTS ON ITS OWN CAN
BE REPRESENTED BY 0 HARM. THE MOVE IS ROLLED AS USUAL, AND CONSEQUENCES
MAY OCCUR. AN INJURY THAT CAUSES 0 HARM DOES NOT SPEND PREPARATIONS.

### HEALING

HEALING, WHETHER MUNDANE OR MAGICAL CAN HELP YOU RECOVER FROM HARM. IN
SOME CASES THIS WILL CAUSE THE MC TO TELL YOU TO ERASE CODES OFF OF YOUR
STATUS TRACKS.

MUNDANE HEALING REVOLVES AROUND MEDICAL TREATMENT, UP TO AND INCLUDING
HOSPITALIZATION. IF YOUR PLAYER CHARACTER IS IN SERIOUS NEED OF MEDICAL
ATTENTION, SOMETIMES THE BEST THING TO DO IS CALL AN AMBULANCE. OF
COURSE HOSPITALS COME WITH SOME RISKS, FROM SNOOPING NURSES WONDERING
WHERE YOUR INJURIES CAME FROM TO THE EVER PRESENT THREAT OF ENORMOUS
MEDICAL BILLS IF YOUR GAME TAKES PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT ALSO
TAKES TIME. HEALING UP TO CODE 40 OR SO IN A HOSPITAL CAN BE RELATIVELY
QUICK, SOMETIMES ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS SURGERY OR SET A BROKEN BONE.
CODES 40 AND 50 ARE USUALLY SLOWER TO HEAL, AND REQUIRE PHYSICAL REST.
THERE ARE EVEN SOME THINGS THAT MUNDANE HEALING CAN NOT FIX. THESE CAN
INCLUDE INJURIES BEYOND MODERN MEDICINE, OR EVEN INJURIES BEYOND MODERN
SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING. A HOSPITAL WILL NOT BE MUCH HELP IF YOUR CODE
30 INJURY IS "MY AURA IS BEING SIPHONED OFF BY A DEMON"

MAGICAL HEALING ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS ITS OWN HOST OF PROBLEMS.
SOMETIMES IN THE MOMENT IT MAY SEEM NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SAVE SOMEONE,
BUT MAGICAL HEALING ALMOST ALWAYS COMES AT A COST. GENERALLY SPEAKING,
ACTUAL HEALING IS LIKELY ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN YOU HAVE AN EXCESS OF TIME
OR MAGICAL ENERGY, IN WHICH CASE YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THE
**RITUAL** MOVES. IN CRISIS SITUATIONS, YOU MAY FIND THE MC OFFERS YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY, BUT WITH A HEAVY COST. A VERY COMMON COST MIGHT BE
LETTING YOU SHIFT HARM AROUND, RATHER THAN ACTUALLY HEALING IT. ALMOST
ANY TIME A PLAYER CHARACTER WANTS TO PERFORM MAGICAL HEALING, THEY WILL
BE TRIGGERING A MOVE (EITHER A BASIC MOVE OR PERHAPS A PLAYBOOK MOVE.)
THE MC SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO HOW THE PLAYER DESCRIBES THEIR CHARACTER
ATTEMPTING TO HEAL SOMEONE, AND CALL FOR THE APPROPRIATE MOVE. KEEP AN
EYE ON **SELL A LIE; ENACT SUDDEN, VIOLENT, OR UNEXPECTED CHANGE ON THE
PHYSICAL WORLD; DESCRIBE A MAGICAL EFFECT WITHIN YOUR PARADIGM BUT
BEYOND YOUR NORMAL ABILITIES; **AND **DO RENDING MAGIC** IN PARTICULAR,
AS WELL AS ANY POTENTIALLY RELEVANT PLAYBOOK MOVES.

ANCHOR STATUS TRACKS
--------------------

EACH ANCHOR THAT EACH PLAYER CHARACTER HAS ON THEIR PLAYBOOK HAS A
STATUS TRACK TO KEEP TRACK OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT ANCHOR. AT
THE BEGINNING OF EACH SESSION, EACH ONE OF THESE STATUS TRACKS IS
ADVANCED BY 1 CODE, AND THEY MAY BE ADVANCED MORE DURING PLAY. IF ONE OF
THESE STATUS TRACKS HITS CODE N, THE MAGE LOSES THAT ANCHOR DUE TO
ATROPHY. IF A PLAYER CHARACTER SPENDS A FULL SCENE TENDING TO THEIR
RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ANCHOR OR SHARES A MOMENT OF HUMANITY WITH THAT
ANCHOR, CLEAR THAT STATUS TRACK OF ALL CROSSED OFF CODES.

PORTENTS
--------

FROM TIME TO TIME, THINGS WILL HAPPEN IN GAME THAT FEEL LIKE THEY
DESERVE TO BE FOLLOWED UP ON, BUT AREN'T TIED TO ANY OBVIOUS WAY TO
TRACK THEM. MAYBE A FRIEND FELT SNUBBED ABOUT SOMETHING, MAYBE A
CHARACTER MADE A DEAL AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHEN THE DEBT WILL BE CALLED IN,
MAYBE A CHARACTER OR PLAYER HAD AN IDEA THAT WAS TOO JUICY TO JUST
FORGET ABOUT. THEY CAN BE LARGE OR SMALL. IT CAN EVEN JUST BE THAT
SOMETHING FEELS LIKE IT MATTERS, LIKE THE TIME I SAW A CHARACTER REACH
INTO THEIR SISTER'S MIND AND WIPE AWAY A MEMORY. WE KNEW A LINE HAD BEEN
CROSSED, AND THIS SHOULD COME BACK IN THE STORY. ANYWAY, WHEN THIS
HAPPENS, WRITE DOWN ON A SHEET OF PAPER EVERYONE CAN SEE, A SHORT
DESCRIPTION OF THE THING, AND A STATUS TRACK WITH JUST CODES 20, 10, AND
N. AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION, OR WHENEVER IT FEELS APPROPRIATE, MARK
OFF ANOTHER CODE. WHEN YOU HIT CODE N, BRING THE PORTENT INTO PLAY
SOMEHOW, AND CROSS IT OFF THE LIST.

REALITY BREAKS
--------------

SOMETIMES, REALITY FIGHTS BACK. WHEN A MAGE BACKLASHES, IF THEY ARE
UNLUCKY, THEY MAY FIND THEMSELVES IN A REALITY BREAK, A WAY THE
CONSENSUS PROTECTS ITSELF. [REALITY BREAKS](RealityBreaks) HAVE TWO
STATUS TRACKS, WHICH RACE EACH OTHER.

ONE STATUS TRACK DESCRIBES HOW CLOSE THE MAGE IS TO ESCAPING. THE MAGE'S
PLAYER SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF IT. IT IS ADVANCED BY A PARTICULAR MOVE
DEFINED BY THE PLAYER AND THE MC WHEN THE MAGE FIRST ENTERS THE REALITY
BREAK. THE MOVE'S TRIGGER INDICATES THE MAGE LEARNING THEIR LESSON, OR
AT LEAST GOING ALONG WITH WHAT IS NEEDED FROM THEM TO EXIST IN
CONSENSUAL REALITY. IT IS ALWAYS OF THE FORM:

"WHEN **\[TRIGGER\]**, ADVANCE THE REALITY BUBBLE ESCAPE STATUS TRACK."

THE TRIGGER SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY FOR THE MAGE'S PLAYER TO PUSH FOR.

THE SECOND STATUS TRACK DESCRIBES HOW CLOSE THE REALITY BUBBLE IS TO
PERMANENTLY CLAIMING THE MAGE, AND THE MC SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF IT. THIS
STATUS TRACK IS ADVANCED AT THE START OF EVERY SCENE IN THE REALITY
BUBBLE, AND IT IS ONLY A SOFT MOVE TO ADVANCE IT IN RESPONSE TO THE MAGE
GOING ALONG WITH THE SCENE, STRUGGLING AGAINST IT WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T,
OR FAILING TO LEARN THEIR LESSON.

THE RACE THAT THE TWO STATUS TRACKS CREATE SHOULD PUT SOME FAIRLY
SERIOUS PRESSURE ON THE MAGE, IF THEY'RE AWARE OF IT, OR AT LEAST THE
MAGE'S PLAYER. IF THE MAGE IS COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS,
THE STATUS TRACK SHOWING THEM SLIPPING INTO THE REALITY BREAK SHOULD
FILL IN AT MOST THREE SCENES. HOWEVER, SINCE THE TRIGGER FOR THE ESCAPE
STATUS TRACK SHOULD BE EASY TO HIT, THE MAGE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FREE
THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE WILLING TO LEARN THE LESSON OFFERED.

IF THE ESCAPE STATUS TRACK REACHES CODE N, THE MAGE RETURNS TO THEIR
NORMAL REALITY IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY. FOR REALITY BREAKS THAT WERE ALL
IN THE MAGE'S HEAD, THEY STOP EXPERIENCING THE HALLUCINATIONS OR
VISIONS, WHICH MIGHT BE JARRING, BUT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE. FOR A POCKET
DIMENSION, ITS EXPULSION OF THE MAGE MIGHT BE MORE DRAMATIC. IT
SHOULDN'T BE RENDING, BUT THE MAGE MIGHT SUDDENLY TURN UP NEAR WHERE
THEY DISAPPEARED, POTENTIALLY DISORIENTED OR OTHERWISE IN BAD SHAPE. THE
POCKET DIMENSION NORMALLY CEASES TO EXIST AT THIS MOMENT.

IF THE STRENGTH OF THE REALITY BREAK REACHES CODE N, THEN THE MAGE IS
TRAPPED IN THAT REALITY PERMANENTLY. THEY ARE NO LONGER A PLAYABLE
CHARACTER. IF THE MAGE WAS IN A POCKET DIMENSION, THEN IT LIKELY
DISCONNECTS FROM REALITY ENTIRELY AND FLOATS AWAY. FOR OTHER REALITY
BREAKS, THE MAGE MIGHT LEAVE REALITY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD, OR MAY KEEP
SEEING THE WORLD IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE WAY, NOW TOO FAR OUT OF TOUCH WITH
REALITY TO AFFECT IT NORMALLY. THE MC MAY BRING THEM BACK AS A THREAT
LATER, AND AS THESE MAGES ARE UNBOUND BY THE LAWS OF THE CONSENSUS THEY
CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS FOR EVERYONE.

WHEN A REALITY BREAK IS CREATED, FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE MOVE:

-   DECIDE ITS FORM, PERVASIVE HALLUCINATIONS, A FANTASY WORLD
    OVERLAYING THE REAL ONE, OR A POCKET DIMENSION YOU FALL INTO

    -   PERVASIVE HALLUCINATIONS COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE A WHITE WHALE
        SHOWING UP IN RANDOM PLACES THAT YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO CHASE.

    -   A FANTASY WORLD OVERLAYING THE REAL ONE COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
        EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD BEING DEAD AND APPEARING AS GHOSTS
        (BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE DEAD)

    -   A POCKET DIMENSION CAN BE ALMOST ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF
        INCLUDING LITERALLY THE CHARACTER'S PERSONAL HELL.

-   CHOOSE A TRAIT OF YOUR PARADIGM TO BE EXPLORED BY THE BREAK

    -   THE TRAITS TO CHOOSE FROM ARE THE NAME OF THE PARADIGM, THE
        ALIGNED, OR EITHER OF THE OPPOSED.

-   DECIDE WHAT THE REALITY BREAK LOOKS LIKE

    -   NOTE THAT SOMETIMES YOU MAY CHANGE EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO
        ANSWERS WHILE YOU ARE DOING THIS, TO BETTER FIT YOUR VISION

    -   CONSIDER THE TYPE OF RENDING MAGIC (OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE) THAT
        LEAD TO THE BACKLASH

    -   CONSIDER THE PARADIGM TRAIT. IF IT IS ALIGNED OR THE NAME,
        CONSIDER MAKING THE REALITY BREAK A WORLD WHERE THAT DOES NOT
        EXIST OR IS NOT POSSIBLE. IF IT IS OPPOSED, CONSIDER MAKING THAT
        THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS IN THE REALITY BREAK, OR HEAVILY
        EMPHASIZE THAT, OR HAVE THE REALITY BREAK PUSH THE MAGE TO DO
        THAT A LOT.

    -   EXPAND A BIT ON WHAT THIS WORLD YOU ARE CREATING, AND WHAT IT
        MEANS FOR THE CHARACTER STUCK IN IT. IF THE FANTASY OVERLAY IS
        THAT NOTHING HAS NAMES, THINK ABOUT HOW THERE WILL BE NO STREET
        SIGNS AND THE CHARACTER IS FUNDAMENTALLY LOST, AND HOW THEY WILL
        NOT BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT MANY SPECIFIC THINGS WITH PROPER
        NOUNS.

-   WRITE A MOVE TO ADVANCE IT'S STATUS TRACK

    -   IF YOU ARE EXPLORING AN OPPOSED, IT CAN BE GOOD TO HAVE THIS
        MOVE BE SOMETHING THAT REASSERTS THE MAGES PARADIGM (SO ACTS
        AGAINST THE OPPOSED) BUT DOESN'T PUSH BACK AGAINST THE WORLD TOO
        HARD.

    -   IF YOU ARE EXPLORING AN ALIGNED, CONSIDER HAVING THIS STATUS
        TRACK ADVANCE WHEN THE MAGE ACCOMPLISHES SOMETHING WITHOUT THE
        USE OF MAGIC, OR WITHOUT RESORTING TO WHAT THEY ARE GOOD AT.

    -   THIS MOVE SPECIFICALLY SHOULD BE SOMETHING ENTIRELY UNDER THE
        PLAYER'S CONTROL, BECAUSE THEY WILL NEED TO PUSH THEIR CHARACTER
        TO DO IT IN ORDER TO WIN THE STATUS TRACK RACE AND KEEP THEIR
        CHARACTER.

FORCES
------

EACH FORCE HAS A STATUS TRACK, REPRESENTING HOW CLOSE IT IS TO MAKING AN
IRREVOCABLE CHANGE ON THE GAME WORLD. THESE STATUS TRACKS HAVE
DESCRIPTIONS ADDED AT CODE 40, CODE 20, AND CODE N. THEY ARE DESCRIPTIVE
AND PRESCRIPTIVE LABELS, SO THAT WHEN THE CODE IS MARKED OFF, THE
DESCRIPTION SHOULD BE MADE TRUE, BUT IF IT HAPPENS IN THE FICTION AND
THE CODE IS NOT YET MARKED OFF, THEN YOU SHOULD DO SO.

THESE STATUS TRACKS CAN BE ADVANCED BY MC MOVES, AND THIS CAN OFTEN
START A NEW SCENE AS THE EFFECTS OF THE ADVANCING STATUS TRACK START TO
BE SEEN. WHEN A FORCE'S STATUS TRACK IS SLIPPING, THIS INDICATES IT WILL
NOW TAKE ACTIVE WORK TO PREVENT THEIR CODE N RESULT FROM COMING TO PASS.

FORCE STATUS TRACKS CAN ALSO BE RESET, IF THEY ARE GIVEN A MAJOR
SETBACK. THIS MAY ALSO INVOLVE CHANGING THE DESCRIPTIONS, AS THE FORCE
MAY HAVE HAD TO RESTRUCTURE OR CHANGE PLANS.

CONSENSUS SHIFT
---------------

WITH CERTAIN ADVANCED MOVES, A MAGE CAN ATTEMPT TO SHIFT THE CONSENSUS
AND CHANGE A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH ABOUT WHAT THE GENERAL POPULACE BELIEVES
TO BE POSSIBLE. THESE STATUS TRACKS ARE DETAILED IN THE {{LINKADVANCED
MOVES}} SECTION OF THE IMPROVEMENT CHAPTER, AND THEY RACE AGAINST THE
CONSENSUS FORCES STATUS TRACK, WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY ONE OF THE OTHER
MAJOR FORCES IN THE WORLD. WHICHEVER ONE HITS CODE N FIRST CAN SET THE
TONE FOR THE SHIFT IN REALITY THAT IS TO COME.

MAGIC
=====

WHAT IS MAGIC YOU MAY BE ASKING? OR "WHERE THE HECK IS ALL THE MAGIC, I
THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THIS GAME WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT!" WELL LOOK NO
FURTHER.

PARADIGM
--------

YOU NEED LIGHT TO SEE. YOU NEED AIR TO BREATHE. THINGS FALL WHEN YOU
DROP THEM. ELECTRICITY ONLY FLOWS IN A COMPLETE CIRCUIT. THERE ARE
RADIOACTIVE METALS. THE SUN IS A STAR, AND THE MOON REFLECTS ITS LIGHT.

ALL OF THESE ARE VERY LIKELY PART OF YOUR MODEL OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS.
YOU CAN USE THIS MODEL TO PLAN FUTURE ACTIONS, AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
MUST HAVE HAPPENED WHEN YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT SOMETHING. YOUR PARADIGM
FOR THE WORLD INVOLVES KNOWN PHYSICAL LAWS, SOCIAL NORMS, LIKELY CAUSES
AND EFFECTS, AND SO ON. IT EVEN INCLUDES THINGS IN WHICH YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CAUSES, BUT YOU DO KNOW OUTCOMES. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO
KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE IN TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T MAKE RENT.

A MAGE'S PARADIGM IS SIMILAR. IT COVERS HOW THE WORLD WORKS, ON SOME
FUNDAMENTAL AND SOME SPECIFIC LEVELS. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS
PARADIGM INCLUDES THINGS WHICH MOST HUMANS WOULD CONSIDER TO BE
IMPOSSIBLE. IT MIGHT BE THAT THERE IS AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE, INFUSED WITH
THE POWER TO AFFECT THE WORLD IF SPOKEN ALOUD. IT MIGHT BE THAT A DIVINE
POWER HAS CHOSEN THEM TO WORK THE POWER'S WILL IN THE WORLD, AND AS LONG
AS THEY ARE ACTING IN LINE WITH THE PLAN, THEY CAN PERFORM MIRACLES. IT
EVEN MIGHT BE A BRANCH OF PHYSICS THAT IS HITHERTO UNEXPLORED BY
CONVENTIONAL SCIENCE, ALLOWING ACCESS TO OTHER DIMENSIONS AND ENABLING
WONDEROUS DEVICES. MAGES DO LIVE IN SOMETHING AKIN TO THE REAL WORLD, SO
THEIR PARADIGMS WILL INCLUDE MAJOR PARTS OF THE PARADIGM THEY HAD BEFORE
THEY AWAKENED, AS A BACKDROP.

THE KEY TO A MAGE IS THAT THEIR PARADIGM IS NOT JUST A BELIEF SYSTEM: IT
REALLY WORKS. NO MATTER HOW STRONGLY A PERSON WHO IS NOT A MAGE BELIEVES
THAT THEY CAN TELEPORT, IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK. HOWEVER, A MAGE CAN ACT
ACCORDING TO THEIR PARADIGM, AND WHAT THEY EXPECT WILL USUALLY HAPPEN.
SO, IF THEY BELIEVE THAT A RITUAL CIRCLE INSCRIBED IN THE GROUND USING
AN ANCIENT LANGUAGE THAT DESCRIBES A LOCATION WILL ALLOW TRAVEL TO THAT
LOCATION IF IT IS ENTERED WITH A CLEAR MIND UNDER A FULL MOON, THEN THAT
WILL WORK FOR THEM (MOST OF THE TIME, IF THEY'RE CAREFUL).

PARADIGMS ARE VERY PERSONAL. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE MOSTLY SHARED, THERE ARE
LIKELY TO BE SOME DETAILS THAT DIFFER. IT'S AN EFFECT OF BEING ABLE TO
SHAPE YOUR OWN REALITY. THIS DOES MEAN THAT TWO MAGE'S MAGICS MAY NOT
WORK FOR EACH OTHER AT ALL. IN EXTREME CASES, THEIR BELIEFS MAY ACTIVELY
CLASH (SEE OPPOSED, PAGE XX).

WHEN CHOOSING A PARADIGM FOR A CHARACTER, LOOK AT THE LISTED ONES IN THE
PLAYBOOK. THE CHOICES WILL COVER A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE BELIEF SYSTEMS
TAILORED TO THAT PLAYBOOK, AND IN FACT EACH INDIVIDUAL PARADIGM CHOICE
IS LIKELY TO ENCOMPASS MULTIPLE POSSIBILITIES. YOU WILL NEED TO CHOOSE
SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU, THE PLAYER, BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED TO
JUSTIFY YOUR MAGE'S ACTIONS IN TERMS OF THIS PARADIGM. THIS ALSO LIKELY
MEANS THERE WILL BE SOME INTERPRETATION, AS THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO
USE THE ASPECTS WRITTEN OUT FOR EACH PARADIGM TO DESCRIBE A VIEW OF THE
WORLD.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO SUMMARIZE ALL OF A PERSON'S BELIEFS IN A SMALL
SECTION. IN CONSENSUS, KEY ASPECTS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO MAGIC ARE CALLED
OUT.

### TITLE

THE TITLE OF A PARADIGM IS JUST A LABEL, BUT USUALLY INDICATES SOMETHING
ABOUT THE FLAVOR OR APPROACH THAT IT ENTAILS. "TRUE NAMES GIVE COMMAND"
SUGGESTS THE POWER OF "TRUE" NAMES (THOUGH WHETHER THAT MEANS THE FIRST
GIVEN NAME, A SECRET NAME KNOWN ONLY TO THE ARCANE, OR SOMETHING ELSE
ENTIRELY, IS UP TO YOU), WHILE "REALITY HAS AN API" SUGGESTS A
TECHNOLOGICAL APPROACH, PERHAPS WITH A MAGICAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OR
THE CRAFTING OF DEVICES WHICH CAN CHANGE THE WORLD'S PROPERTIES.

### ALIGNED

ALIGNED ASPECTS ARE PARTS OF THE PARADIGM THAT THE MAGE IS PARTICULARLY
GOOD AT. THIS MAY HAVE TO DO WITH THEIR BELIEFS (A MAGE WHO BELIEVES IN
A CURRENT OF LIFE ENERGY FLOWING THROUGH THE UNIVERSE IS LIKELY TO BE
GOOD AT HEALING), OR JUST BE A PARTICULAR FOCUS WITHIN WHAT'S POSSIBLE
(A MAGE WHO BELIEVES THAT REALITY CAN BE PROGRAMMED MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
TO HAVE SPECIALIZED IN DELETION, OUT OF A VARIETY OF POSSIBILITIES.) USE
THE LISTED CHOICES IN ALIGNED FOR A SENSE OF WHAT THE PARADIGM CAN
LIKELY DO.

YOUR CHARACTER'S ALIGNED ASPECT MAKES IT EASIER TO HELP RELATED ACTIONS,
AND MAGIC WHICH IS ALIGNED TO YOUR CHARACTER'S PARADIGM HAS A CHANCE OF
BEING PARTICULARLY, REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL.

### OPPOSED

OPPOSED ASPECTS ARE THINGS WHICH YOUR MAGE BELIEVES ARE IMPOSSIBLE, AS
FIRMLY AS YOU PROBABLY BELIEVE THAT THE SUN RISES EACH DAY. THESE WILL
NEVER APPLY TO ANYTHING WHICH A NON-MAGE COULD DO, BUT DEFINITELY CAN
COVER THINGS WHICH OTHER MAGES MAY DO. THE EVEN MAY APPLY TO THINGS YOUR
OWN MAGE MIGHT APPEAR TO BE CAPABLE OF. HAVING THEM LISTED UNDER OPPOSED
MEANS THAT THERE IS A DETAIL TO THE MAGE'S PARADIGM THAT COMPLETELY
PRECLUDES THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A MAGE HAS "EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION" AS
AN OPPOSED ASPECT, THEN THAT MEANS THAT THEY DO NOT THINK IT FITS INTO
THEIR WORLDVIEW. IF THE WORLDVIEW LOOKS VERY BROAD AND FLEXIBLE, LIKE
"ANCIENT LANGUAGES HOLD SECRET POWER," THEN THERE IS A REASON IT IS
OPPOSED. PERHAPS THE LANGUAGE CAME FROM BEFORE HUMANS WERE EVOLVED
ENOUGH TO MANIPULATE EMOTIONS, RATHER THAN JUST FEEL AND EXPRESS THEM
LIKE ANIMALS. PERHAPS IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS AND WAS SEALED AWAY BY AN
ANCIENT MAGE. OR PERHAPS IT IS UNKNOWN TO THE MAGE, THEY JUST HAVE A
DEEP SENSE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AS CONTINUING TO LIVE WITHOUT BREATHING
WOULD BE IF THEY HAD NO MAGIC.

NOTE THAT OPPOSED ASPECTS REFLECT STRONG ENOUGH BELIEFS THAT THEY EVEN
APPLY TO OTHER MAGES. IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOUR CHARACTER CAN'T WORK
OBSCURING MAGIC, FOR EXAMPLE, IT'S THAT NO-ONE CAN. FOR THESE PURPOSES,
A CHARACTER WHO IS OPPOSED TO MAGIC BEING DONE IS A [LOOKOUT](Lookouts),
EXACTLY LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER AWAKENED AT ALL. THIS MEANS THAT A
CHARACTER WITH A REALLY RESTRICTIVE VIEW OF THE WORLD, LIKE THAT THE
ONLY MAGIC THAT EXISTS HAS TO BE DONE THROUGH A COMPUTER TERMINAL (WHICH
THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN CONSIDER MAGIC) MAY BE TRICKY TO BE AROUND. MAGES BY
THEIR NATURE HAVE TO BE SKILLED AT CONCEALING THEIR CRAFT, HOWEVER, AND
NOTHING IS INSURMOUNTABLE. HARMONIOUS MAGIC WILL SLIP BY JUST FINE, BUT
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO RENDING MAGIC IN FRONT OF ANOTHER MAGE, YOU'LL
WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY AREN'T OPPOSED TO ANY ASPECT OF WHAT YOU'RE
DOING.

PAY ATTENTION WHEN CHOOSING OPPOSED MAGIC TO THE PARADIGMS OF OTHERS AT
THE TABLE. WHILE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH PLAYING MAGES WHO BELIEVE
THAT EACH OTHER'S MAGIC IS IMPOSSIBLE, IT DOES MAKE FOR A VERY DIFFERENT
GAME THAN IF THEY ALL MORE-OR-LESS AGREE. THAT BEING SAID, SINCE ALL
PARADIGMS ARE DIFFERENT, NO-ONE WILL EVER FULLY AGREE ON EVERYTHING.

A MAGE MAY BE ABLE TO BREAK PAST THEIR OPPOSED, AND DO MAGIC THAT IS
OPPOSED TO THEIR OWN PARADIGM, BUT IT WILL ALWAYS BE RENDING IF THEY DO.

### FREEDOMS

FREEDOMS ARE ONE OF THE PERKS THAT COME WITH WORKING WITH OTHER MAGES
OVER TIME. ANOTHER MAGE MAY CHOOSE, WHEN THEY TAKE AN ADVANCEMENT, TO
GRANT YOUR MAGE A FREEDOM. THIS IS A SHORT PHRASE OR SENTENCE THAT
DESCRIBES HOW SOMETHING WHICH APPEARS TO FALL UNDER ONE OF YOUR OPPOSED
ASPECTS IS ACTUALLY JUST FINE. THE FREEDOM ONLY COMES INTO PLAY WHEN YOU
ARE WORKING WITH THE CHARACTER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU. IF PIPER, WHO HAS AN
OPPOSED ASPECT OF "SILENT MAGIC", IS GIVEN THE FREEDOM "THERE IS SOUND
AMONG THE SPIRITS" BY MARCUS, THEN WHEN PIPER AND MARCUS DO MAGIC
TOGETHER, PIPER CAN DO MAGIC THAT APPEARS TO BE SILENT IN THE PHYSICAL
WORLD, AS LONG AS IT SOMEHOW INVOLVES "SOUND" IN CONNECTION WITH
SPIRITS.

FREEDOMS CAN BE VERY USEFUL, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MAGES TEND TO BECOME
LESS ABLE TO DIRECTLY HELP ONE ANOTHER AS THEY BECOME MORE POWERFUL
(BECAUSE HELP OR HINDER USES THE NUMBER OF ANCHORS TO MODIFY THE ROLL).
FREEDOMS LET THEM STOP HIDING SOME OF THEIR MAGIC FROM EACH OTHER, AND
REWARD COLLABORATION.

### RESTRICTIONS

RESTRICTIONS ARE NEW HOLES DISCOVERED IN A MAGE'S VIEW OF WHAT IS
POSSIBLE. THEY OFTEN COME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT FAILURE: NOT
ONLY ARE YOU UNABLE TO DO THAT THIS TIME, YOU'RE UNABLE TO DO IT AT ALL.
THEY CAN COVER NEW DISCOVERIES IN THE FICTION ABOUT THE EXACT SHAPE OF
THE PARADIGM, AND THEY CAN COVER NEW BELIEFS GAINED BY THE MAGE ("I
GUESS I ACTUALLY CAN'T BREATHE UNDERWATER.") LIKE FREEDOMS, THEY ARE
SHORT PHRASES OR SENTENCES, BUT THEY ADD ON TO OPPOSED ASPECTS, RATHER
THAN PROVIDING A WAY TO BYPASS THEM. A CHARACTER WITH THE OPPOSED ASPECT
"MAGIC THAT PREVENTS MOVEMENT" MIGHT GAIN THE RESTRICTION "MOVEMENT FOR
SPIRITS INCLUDES MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS," AND NOW ANYTHING THAT WOULD TRAP
A SPIRIT ON ONE PLANE IS AS UNREACHABLE AS IF IT WERE OPPOSED. WHEN
SOMETHING SAYS IT APPLIES IF A MAGE IS OPPOSED, THIS INCLUDES IF THEY
HAVE A RESTRICTION THAT APPLIES.

UNLIKE THE OPPOSED ASPECTS, RESTRICTIONS CAN BE OVERCOME. THERE IS AN
ADVANCEMENT A MAGE CAN TAKE TO REMOVE A RESTRICTION THAT THEY HAVE
GAINED, REPRESENTING AN EXPANSION OF UNDERSTANDING OR SELF-CONFIDENCE BY
THE MAGE.

MAGIC AND MOVES
---------------

THERE'S NO ONE MOVE IN THIS GAME THAT YOU ROLL TO JUST "DO MAGIC."
INSTEAD, MAGIC INFUSES THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE GAME. ALMOST ANY MOVE YOU
CAN ROLL COULD BE TRIGGERED BY YOU DOING MAGIC. REMEMBER, YOU DON'T TELL
THE MC "I WANT TO ROLL THE ASSERT YOUR PARADIGM MOVE," YOU DESCRIBE WHAT
YOUR CHARACTER DOES, AND THE MC WILL LET YOU KNOW IF IT TRIGGERS A MOVE.

PLAYBOOK MOVES CAN BE THOUGHT OF IN MANY WAYS AS ROTE MAGIC, SPELLS YOUR
CHARACTER IS FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH TO GET A CONSISTENT SET OF RESULTS
WHEN THEY TRY TO CAST THEM. IF YOU DESCRIBE DOING MAGIC, EVEN MAGIC THAT
IS CLOSE TO BUT DOES NOT TRIGGER A PLAYBOOK MOVE, IT MAY JUST TRIGGER A
BASIC MOVE INSTEAD, AND HAVE MUCH MORE UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS.

IN CASES WHERE THE MC ISN'T SURE WHAT MOVE IS TRIGGERED BY A MAGE
ATTEMPTING TO DO SLIGHTLY RISKY HARMONIOUS MAGIC, IT COULD BE THAT THEY
JUST DON'T ROLL A MOVE, AND THE MC MAKES A SOFT MOVE IN RESPONSE. OR, IN
MOST CASES A MAGE DOING MAGIC THAT DOESN'T CAUSE BACKLASH COULD BE
DESCRIBED AS THEM SELLING A LIE TO THE CONSENSUS AS A WHOLE.

LET'S LOOK AT SOME EXAMPLES OF MOVES, AND HOW THEY CAN BE BOTH MUNDANE
AND MAGICAL.

TOBIAS IS CORNERED, AND REALLY NEEDS A DISTRACTION TO GET OUT OF THERE.
BECAUSE THEY WORK WITH ELECTRICITY AS A MAJOR PART OF THEIR MAGIC, THEIR
EYE CATCHES ON A TELEPHONE POLE AND A TRANSFORMER RIGHT NEARBY. TOBIAS'
PLAYER TELLS THE MC THAT TOBIAS IS GOING TO REDIRECT THE FLOW OF POWER
BRIEFLY TO OVERLOAD THE TRANSFORMER AND CAUSE A VERY DISTRACTING
PYROTECHNIC DISPLAY. THE MC RESPONDS THAT THIS SEEMS LIKE THE VERY
DEFINITION OF ENACTING A SUDDEN OR UNEXPECTED CHANGE ON THE PHYSICAL
WORLD. TOBIAS' PLAYER AGREES, AND SO ROLLS THE MOVE.DOVE, ON THE OTHER
HAND, IS ALSO CORNERED, BUT DOESN'T WANT TO USE MAGIC TO GET OUT OF THE
SITUATION, BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TOO RECENTLY REMINDED BY THE CONSENSUS
THAT MAGIC DOESN'T FIX EVERYTHING. SO DOVE'S PLAYER DESCRIBES DOVE
THROWING A ROCK AT A DILAPIDATED WALL NEARBY, TO BRING IT DOWN ON THEIR
PURSUERS AND DISTRACT THEM LONG ENOUGH FOR DOVE TO GET AWAY. THIS IS
ALSO ENACTING SUDDEN (VIOLENT) AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE ON THE WORLD, EVEN
THOUGH THERE WAS NO MAGIC INVOLVED.

HARMONIOUS MAGIC
----------------

MOST MAGIC THAT MAGES DO IS BARELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM COINCIDENCE OR
EXTREME LUCK. THERE'S A REASON FOR THIS. THAT KIND OF MAGIC IS EASY, AND
SAFE. INSTEAD OF CREATING MONEY OUT OF THIN AIR, A MAGE PREFERS TO FIND
THE EXACT LOCATION BURIED TREASURE IS HIDDEN, RIGHT IN THEIR BACKYARD.
MAYBE IT WAS THERE BEFORE THEY DID THEIR MAGIC, AND THEIR MAGIC JUST
ALLOWED THEM TO FIND IT. OR MAYBE THEIR MAGIC PUT IT THERE JUST MINUTES
BEFORE IT WAS DUG UP. EITHER WAY, THE CASUAL ONLOOKER (AND THEREFORE THE
CONSENSUS) CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE. THIS IS CALLED HARMONIOUS MAGIC.
THIS KIND OF MAGIC ACTS IN HARMONY WITH REALITY, CIRCUMVENTS THE RULES
OF THE UNIVERSE, AND NOBODY'S THE WISER. THERE'S A REASON YOU DON'T SEE
MAGES THROWING BALLS OF FIRE DOWN THE STREETS OF CHICAGO. NOBODY'S
PARADIGM IS GOING TO BE VIOLATED BY A MAGE HAPPENING TO HAVE EXACTLY THE
SMALL ITEM THAT THEY NEED IN THEIR POCKET.

RENDING MAGIC
-------------

BUT WHAT IF YOUR CHARACTER THINKS THEY REALLY NEED TO THROW A FIREBALL
DOWN THE STREETS OF CHICAGO? WELL FIRST, THEY'RE ALMOST CERTAINLY WRONG,
RENDING MAGIC CAUSES MANY MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT FIXES IN 99 OUT OF 100
CASES. BUT IF THEY'RE DEAD SET ON DOING IT, THEY'RE PERFORMING RENDING
MAGIC. TO DO THAT REQUIRES TEARING A RATHER LARGE HOLE IN REALITY, AND
THAT'S WHEN REALITY FIGHTS BACK. IF AN EFFECT FOR ANY REASON CAN'T BE
PASSED OF AS COINCIDENCE OR HAPPENSTANCE TO THE CASUAL ONLOOKER, THE
EFFECT IS VERY LIKELY RENDING. NOTABLY, WHEN YOU DO RENDING MAGIC, IT
JUST WORKS, AND YOU ROLL THE MOVE IF IT AFFECTS A LOOKOUT. THIS CAN BE
VERY POWERFUL, BUT THE COSTS ARE VERY HIGH.

### LOOKOUTS

SOMETIMES YOU CAN TEAR HOLES IN REALITY AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE NO
ONE IS AROUND TO ACT AS EYES AND EARS FOR THE CONSENSUS. RENDING MAGIC
ONLY TRIGGERS THE RENDING MAGIC MOVE WHEN IT AFFECTS A LOOKOUT. A
LOOKOUT IS ANY NON-MAGE HUMAN, AND ANY MAGE WHO'S PARADIGM IS OPPOSED TO
THAT RENDING EFFECT. HOWEVER, "AFFECTS" SHOULD BE TAKEN AS BROADLY AS
POSSIBLE HERE. IF A LOOKOUT SEES THE MAGIC BEING DONE, IF THEY ARE
TARGETED BY IT, OR IF A RIPPLE EFFECT CAUSES THEM TO SNEEZE FROM THE
WIND GENERATED BY YOUR SUMMONED WIND GOLEM, THOSE ARE ALL BEING
AFFECTED. IF YOU SUMMON A BAR OF GOLD IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR OWN WARDED
LAB, THAT'S FINE, UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU HAND THAT BAR OF GOLD TO A
NON-MAGE AS PAYMENT, AT WHICH POINT YOU ROLL THE RENDING MAGIC MOVE. YOU
CAN ANIMATE A GOLEM IN YOUR BASEMENT, AND AS LONG AS NO ONE SEES IT OR
HEARS A DISTINCTIVE SOUND THAT NO HUMAN COULD MAKE, YOU'RE ALL SET. BUT
WHEN THE HOUSEKEEPER OPENS THE LOCKED BASEMENT DOOR AND SEES AN ANIMATED
HUMANOID FORM MADE OUT OF CLAY, NO MATTER WHERE YOUR MAGE IS, THEY ROLL
THE RENDING MAGIC MOVE.

DISCORD
-------

DISCORD IS A BUILDUP OF SOME SORT, REALITY LEAVING ITS MARK ON MAGES WHO
DARE TO TEAR HOLES IN IT LEFT AND RIGHT. THE MORE THE DISCORD BUILDS UP,
THE MORE THE CONSENSUS IS GOING TO KICK YOU IN THE BUTT WHEN IT FINALLY
COMES TIME TO PAY THE PIPER. TRACK YOUR DISCORD ON YOUR PLAYBOOK, AND
IT'S BEST NOT TO LET IT BUILD UP TOO MUCH.

BACKLASH
--------

THIS IS THE UNIVERSE'S WAY OF FIXING ITSELF AFTER A HOLE IS TORN IN IT
BY RENDING MAGIC. IT IS ALSO THE PUNISHMENT FOR MAGES WHO BREAK THE
RULES TOO EGREGIOUSLY. SOMETIMES A BACKLASH IS MINOR, THE EQUIVALENT OF
A SLAP ON THE WRIST. SOMETIMES YOU'RE BANISHED FROM REALITY ITSELF.
DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOU'VE BEEN MESSING WITH REALITY, AND HOW MUCH IT
FEELS LIKE MESSING BACK.

WHEN YOU TRIGGER THE BACKLASH MOVE, THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES THAT
ROLLING LOWER IS BETTER, AND YOU ROLL ADDING YOUR CURRENT DISCORD. ROLL
HIGH ENOUGH AND YOU CAUSE A LOCALIZED BREAK IN REALITY. MORE OFTEN
THOUGH, WHAT WILL MANIFEST IS EITHER SOME PHYSICAL SIGN OF YOUR DISCORD,
MAKING YOUR LIFE DIFFICULT, OR A BEING OF SOME SORT, SENT BY THE
CONSENSUS TO ENFORCE ITS WILL ON YOU.

PHYSICAL SIGNS OF DISCORD SHOULD AFFECT THE CHARACTER NEGATIVELY FOR THE
REST OF THE SESSION. THINGS LIKE MILK SPOILING AROUND YOU, ELECTRONICS
REFUSING TO WORK IN YOUR PRESENCE, OR EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT AND
AVERSION TO THE SUN.

ENFORCERS FOR THE CONSENSUS CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES, THEY WILL
LIKELY TAKE ON A FORM THAT MAKES SENSE WITHIN THE MAGE'S PARADIGM. THEY
MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE SEEN BY OTHER MAGES, DEPENDING ON THE
CIRCUMSTANCES. ONE THING IS CONSTANT BETWEEN ALL PHYSICAL SIGNS OF
DISCORD AND ENFORCERS THOUGH. USING MAGIC TO TRY AND GET RID OF THEM OR
MITIGATE THEIR CONSEQUENCES WILL ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE.

REALITY BREAKS
--------------

SOMETIMES, WHEN THE CONSENSUS IS PARTICULARLY PUSHED AGAINST, A MAGE
NEEDS TO LEARN A LESSON, REALITY BREAKS AROUND THEM. THIS CAN TAKE A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMS, PERVASIVE HALLUCINATIONS THAT ONLY THE MAGE
CAN SEE, AN ENTIRE FANTASY WORLD OVERLAYING THE REAL WORLD, MAKING THE
MAGE THINK THEY'VE BEEN TRANSPORTED ELSEWHERE WHILE IN REALITY THEY
WREAK HAVOC ON THEIR WORLD, OR A POCKET DIMENSION, ACTUALLY TRANSPORTING
THEM ELSEWHERE FOR A TIME OUT FROM REALITY.

YOU MAY HAVE READ THE SECTION ON RENDING MAGIC AND WONDERED HOW THE
WORLD SURVIVES WITH THAT MUCH POWER IN SOMEONE'S HAND. WHY HASN'T A MAGE
BLOTTED OUT THE SUN, OR CRACKED THE TECTONIC PLATES OF THE EARTH? WELL,
WHEN THEY TRY, REALITY TENDS TO BREAK AROUND THEM. THEY MAY VERY WELL GO
ON LIVING IN A POCKET DIMENSION WHERE THEY DID BLOT OUT THE SUN. OR A
FANTASY WORLD WITH A TECTONIC RIFT ACROSS THE CITY MAY OVERLAY THE
ACTUAL WORLD FOR THEM.

THESE TAKE A FEW DIFFERENT FORMS, BUT REGARDLESS OF FORM, THEY ARE THE
CONSENSUS' WAY OF PROTECTING ITSELF. THIS IS WHY, EVEN THOUGH RENDING
MAGIC CAN THEORETICALLY DO ANYTHING, YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT MAGES BLOTTING
OUT THE SUN (FOR MORE THAN A SHORT ECLIPSE). IF A MAGE IS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GET OUT OF ONE, THEY ARE USUALLY HUMBLED AND HAVE LEARNED TO BE MORE
IN TUNE WITH THE CONSENSUS, OR AT LEAST HAVE LEARNED TO BE MORE CAREFUL
WITH THE MAGIC THEY DO.

FROM THE OUTSIDE, REALITY BREAKS ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE
DON'T SEE, OR WON'T SEE. PERVASIVE HALLUCINATIONS ARE THINGS THAT ONLY
THE AFFECTED MAGE CAN SEE, AND MANY PEOPLE ARE PRACTICED AT IGNORING
SOMEONE THEY THINK IS SEEING THINGS. AN OVERLAYED FANTASY WORLD IS
SIMILAR, IN THAT IT ONLY EXISTS FOR THE AFFECTED MAGE (AND PERHAPS OTHER
MAGES THAT KNOW HOW TO LOOK FOR IT). POCKET DIMENSIONS, FROM THE
OUTSIDE, MAY JUST LOOK LIKE THE PERSON DISAPPEARING, AND ANY ONLOOKERS
HAVING THEIR MEMORY OF THE PAST FEW SECONDS WIPED. FOR A PRACTICED EYE,
A MAGE MAY BE ABLE TO FIND THE PINPRICK HOLE IN REALITY THAT CAUSED THE
BREAK, AND FOLLOW IT THROUGH TO ATTEMPT A RESCUE.

WHEN YOU FALL INTO A REALITY BREAK, YOU CHOOSE A TRAIT OF YOUR PARADIGM
(EITHER THE NAME, THE ALIGNED, OR THE OPPOSED) TO BE EXPLORED BY THE
BREAK. IN GENERAL, THE MC SHOULD SHAPE THE REALITY BREAK TO THAT PART OF
THE PARADIGM (EITHER BY MAKING IT MORE PROMINENT, OR INVERTING IT), AND
TO THE RENDING MAGIC THAT CAUSED THE BREAK IN THE FIRST PLACE.

THE MC AND PLAYER THEN WORK TOGETHER TO WRITE A MOVE THAT, WHEN
TRIGGERED, BRINGS THE MAGE BACK CLOSER TO REALITY. THIS SHOULD BE A
RELATIVELY EASY TRIGGER FOR THE MAGE'S PLAYER TO PUSH FOR, BECAUSE
THEY'LL NEED TO DO IT 6 TIMES IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THE REALITY BREAK (ONCE
FOR EACH SECTION OF A FULL STATUS TRACK.) THE MC WILL ALSO MAKE A STATUS
TRACK, REPRESENTING THE STRENGTH OF THE REALITY BREAK.

THE MC WILL THEN FRAME THREE SCENES FOR THE MAGE. AT THE BEGINNING OF
EACH OF THESE SCENES, THE STRENGTH OF REALITY BREAK TRACK WILL ADVANCE
ONCE. DURING EACH SCENE, THE MC MAY ADVANCE THE STRENGTH OF REALITY
BREAK TRACK AS A SOFT MOVE IN RESPONSE TO THE MAGE GOING ALONG WITH THE
SCENE OR FAILING TO LEARN THEIR LESSON. THIS MEANS THAT BY THE END OF
THE THIRD SCENE, EITHER THE MAGE WILL HAVE ADVANCED THEIR ESCAPE TRACK
TO CODE N AND BROKEN OUT OF THE REALITY BREAK, OR THE STRENGTH OF
REALITY BREAK TRACK WILL REACH CODE N IN WHICH CASE... THE MAGE IS
TRAPPED IN THAT REALITY PERMANENTLY. THEY ARE NO LONGER A PLAYABLE
CHARACTER, THOUGH THE MC MAY BRING THEM BACK AS A THREAT LATER, THESE
MAGES ARE UNBOUND BY THE LAWS OF THE CONSENSUS AND CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS
FOR EVERYONE.

RITUALS
-------

A RITUAL IS ANY LARGER MAGICAL WORKING UNDERTAKEN BY ONE OR MORE
CHARACTERS. RITUALS INCREASE THE POWER THAT CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR, AND
ALLOW MORE SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS AND RESULTS TO BE SET OUT AHEAD OF
TIME. A RITUAL IS OFTEN THE RIGHT OPTION WHEN TIME ALLOWS.

A RITUAL HAS TWO PHASES: PLANNING AND PERFORMING.

### PLANNING A RITUAL

IN ORDER TO PERFORM A RITUAL, YOU MUST KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, FIRST.
PLANNING REQUIRES "SOME TIME AND RELATIVE SAFETY." IT ALLOWS YOU TO
SPECIFY THE EFFECT YOU ARE TRYING FOR, IN MUCH MORE DETAIL THAN YOU
WOULD IF YOU WERE SIMPLY DOING MAGIC ON THE FLY. THE MC WILL ASSIGN SOME
REQUIREMENTS TO PERFORM THE RITUAL.

SOME RITUALS ARE MADE UP TO SOLVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM, WITHIN A
SPECIFIC SITUATION. THESE RITUALS DRAW ON THE PARADIGMS OF MAGES
INVOLVED, AS WELL AS ANY RESOURCES THEY HAVE AVAILABLE, AND ARE
"RITUALS" BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY INVOLVED IN THEM, ABOVE AND BEYOND A
SIMPLE SPELL. OTHER RITUALS ARE CEREMONIES IN THE MORE TRADITIONAL
SENSE, PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION, OR REDISCOVERED IN OLD
LORE. THESE RITUALS LIKELY HAVE MUCH LESS PLANNING TO DO, BECAUSE MOST
OF THE PLANNING WAS ACCOMPLISHED LONG AGO. IT WILL STILL BE NECESSARY TO
FIT THEM TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER.

ONCE YOU HAVE PLANNED THE RITUAL, YOU NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN. THIS
ENSURES THAT IMPORTANT DETAILS AREN'T LOST.

### PERFORMING A RITUAL

PERFORMING A RITUAL HAS MORE REQUIREMENTS THAN PLANNING ONE. TO START
WITH, IT MUST BE AT A PLACE OF POWER THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE RITUAL.
TIME AND RELATIVE SAFETY ARE REQUIREMENTS LIKE FOR PLANNING. IN
ADDITION, THERE WILL BE A SENSE OF HOW MANY MAGES ARE NEEDED, AND THEY
ALL MUST BE PRESENT. IT WOULD LIKELY HELP IF THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE
PLANNING PHASE AS WELL, BUT THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT.

AS THE RITUAL BEGINS, EACH MAGE'S PLAYER MUST EXPLAIN HOW THEIR MAGE
CONTRIBUTES WITHIN THEIR PARADIGM. SIMPLY BEING PRESENT IS USUALLY NOT
GOOD ENOUGH, AND A MAGE CAN ONLY CONTRIBUTE IF THEY BELIEVE THEIR
CONTRIBUTION IS POSSIBLE. A MYSTIC MAGE MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME
EXPLAINING HOW THEY CAN ADD TO A RITUAL WHICH TAKES THE FORM OF AN
ALL-NIGHT HACKATHON. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS DOING MAGIC, ALMOST CERTAINLY
IN VIEW OF EACH OTHER, THIS IS A TIME WHEN OPPOSED ASPECTS CAN REALLY
GET IN THE WAY.

A RITUAL DOES NOT TECHNICALLY HAVE TO BE PLANNED. IF A GROUP OF MAGES
SIMPLY GATHER TOGETHER AT A PLACE OF POWER AND START WORKING (OR EVEN
JUST START ACTING IN CONCERT), *SOMETHING* IS BOUND TO HAPPEN. HOWEVER,
WITH A PLAN TO FOLLOW, THEY CAN SPECIFY THE OUTCOME MUCH MORE PRECISELY.

THE MAGE WHO IS LEADING THE RITUAL ROLLS THE MOVE. THE OTHER MAGES ARE
NECESSARY, AND CAN ONLY HELP OR HINDER IF THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOVE
AND BEYOND THEIR PRESCRIBED ROLES. THE OUTCOMES CAN BE RATHER DANGEROUS,
SO A RITUAL SHOULD NEVER BE UNDERTAKEN LIGHTLY.

### PLACE OF POWER

PLACES OF POWER ARE LOCATIONS WITH A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF MAGIC, FOR
ONE REASON OR ANOTHER. THESE TEND TO BE NATURALLY OCCURRING, LIKE
LEY-LINE NODES, WHICH ARE JEALOUSLY GUARDED SECRETS, OR ELSE CONSTRUCTED
WITH A COPIOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY FROM MANY MAGES. PLACES WITH
RESIDUAL MAGIC LIKE THIS ARE PARAMOUNT WHEN PUTTING TOGETHER RITUALS OF
GREAT POWER, SO THEY ARE COVETED BY GROUPS OF MAGES WISHING TO WORK
LARGE MAGICS, OR SINGULAR MAGES WHO NEED TO DRAW ON GREAT AMOUNTS OF
POWER.

SOME PLAYBOOKS HAVE ACCESS TO A PLACE OF POWER THROUGH OPTIONAL MOVES.
OTHER PLACES OF POWER MAY SHOW UP DURING PLAY. BE CAREFUL ALLOWING THE
PLAYERS TO PERMANENTLY GAIN ACCESS TO A PLACE OF POWER IF THERE ISN'T A
PLAYBOOK MOVE SPECIFICALLY GRANTING IT TO THEM. THERE SHOULD BE A REAL
BENEFIT FOR TAKING THAT MOVE, AND THAT'S EASIER ACCESS TO A SPACE IN
WHICH RITUALS WORK. IT MAY BE FINE TO GIVE PLAYERS THAT WORK FOR IT
TEMPORARY ACCESS TO A PLACE OF POWER, OR EVEN ACCESS TO A TEMPORARY
PLACE OF POWER.

SIMILARLY, BE CAREFUL OF RESTRICTING ACCESS TO OR TAKING AWAY PLACES OF
POWER GAINED THROUGH PLAYBOOK MOVES, AT LEAST PERMANENTLY. YOU CAN
CERTAINLY TAKE THEM AWAY TEMPORARILY THOUGH THROUGH MC MOVES LIKE "TAKE
AWAY THEIR STUFF", WHICH CAN BE GOOD MOTIVATION AND DRAMA.

\newpage

ANCHORS AND INSPIRATIONS
========================

ANCHORS
-------

WHEN WE SAY THAT MAGES ARE THE PINNACLE OF HUMANITY, WE MEAN IT. BUT
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS A GOOD THING, RIGHT? THE THING ABOUT BEING AT AN EDGE
OF HUMANITY IS THAT IT'S EASY FOR A MAGE TO STEP OVER THE LINE, AND THAT
MEANS NO LONGER BEING HUMAN. YOUR ANCHORS ARE THE THINGS THAT KEEP YOU
ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE. A LOVED ONE WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MAGIC, AN
ESTATE BOUND UP IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR FAMILY, THE STRAY CAT YOU TOOK IN
OFF THE STREET, OR THE PICTURE OF YOUR BROTHER WHO DIED THE DAY YOU
AWAKENED. ANCHORS ARE BEINGS, OR PHYSICAL OBJECTS, THAT KEEP YOU
GROUNDED IN THE MORTAL WORLD. BUT THEY ALSO HOLD YOU BACK FROM YOUR
FULLEST POTENTIAL. DO YOU WANT TO SHED THE SHACKLES OF YOUR ANCHORS IN
ORDER TO TRANSCEND, OR REMAIN AMONG THEM, BEING A LITTLE BIT BETTER, BUT
KNOW YOU WILL NEVER REACH YOUR FULL POTENTIAL?

ANCHORS CANNOT BE MAGICAL IN NATURE. OTHER MAGES, SPIRITS YOU'VE
SUMMONED, ENCHANTED ITEMS, THESE THINGS AREN'T GROUNDED ENOUGH IN
REALITY TO KEEP YOU THERE. YOUR PET CAT WHO BRINGS YOU COMFORT, FINE.
YOUR CAT FAMILIAR, NOT SO FINE.

### STARTING ANCHORS

ALL CHARACTERS START WITH ANCHORS, WHICH SAY THINGS ABOUT WHO THEY HAVE
BEEN SO FAR. EACH PLAYBOOK SUGGESTS DIFFERENT ANCHORS IN THE STARTING
CATEGORIES. AS YOU CHOOSE THEM, THINK ABOUT HOW THEY KEEP YOU GROUNDED,
AND HUMAN. ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO KEEP THEM IN YOUR
LIFE, BE IT PAYING RENT ON AN APARTMENT, OR TAKING CARE OF A LOVED ONE.
NOTE THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE TO FOREGO ANY OF THESE ANCHORS, BUT YOU MAY BE
STARTING YOURSELF AT A DISADVANTAGE.

STARTING ANCHORS FALL UNDER THREE CATEGORIES: SHELTER ANCHORS,
CONNECTION ANCHORS, AND MEMORIES ANCHORS.

#### SHELTER

A SHELTER ANCHOR IS LITERALLY THAT, AN ANCHOR THAT GIVES YOU SHELTER. IT
CAN BE VERY POWERFUL AND GROUNDING TO HAVE A HOME FOR AN ANCHOR, BUT
ALSO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NOT ENCHANTED YOUR HOME AS MUCH AS SOME MAGES
MIGHT. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF USING MAGIC FOR MAINTENANCE, YOU QUICKLY
MIGHT FIND THAT, WHILE STILL A HOME, IT IS NO LONGER AN ANCHOR. FOR SOME
MAGES, HAVING A HOME TO COME BACK TO WHICH IS CALM AND RELAXING CAN KEEP
THEM GROUNDED. FOR OTHERS, THE HOME THEY COME BACK TO AND FIGHT CAN BE A
DIFFERENT, BUT JUST AS REAL, TYPE OF GROUNDING. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
YELLING ABOUT WHO WILL DO THE DISHES THAT CAN GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT DOWN
OUT OF THE CLOUDS.

#### CONNECTION

CONNECTION ANCHORS ARE NOTABLE FOR THEIR AGENCY, AS THEY ARE PEOPLE OR
ANIMALS. KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ANCHORS CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM
DANGER SOMETIMES, BUT ALSO HAVE THE CHOICE TO TURN THEIR BACKS ON YOU.
IF THEY DO SO, IT'S UP TO YOU AT THAT POINT IF THEY REMAIN AN
ANCHOR...BUT IF THEY DO, THEY WON'T MAKE IT EASY ON YOU.

#### MEMORIES

MEMORY ANCHORS ARE THE OBJECTS, SIGNS, AND PLACES THAT CONNECT TO
MEMORIES OF THE PAST AND IDEAS OF THE FUTURE. THEY CAN BE GROUNDING, BUT
NEED TO BE KEPT IN YOUR MIND, AND LIKELY REGULARLY INTERACTED TO OR KEPT
ON HAND, LEST THEY SLIP AWAY.

#### FILLING IN BLANKS

SOME STARTING ANCHORS ARE NOT COMPLETELY FILLED IN TO START, THEY WILL
HAVE A BLANK SPACE LEFT TO FILL IN. CHOOSE SOMETHING EVOCATIVE TO WRITE
THERE, IF YOU PICK THAT STARTING ANCHOR, AND BE READY TO EXPLORE WHAT IT
MEANS. KEEP IN MIND THE CATEGORY OF ANCHOR IT IS IN, AND DON'T FILL IN
THE BLANK IN A WAY THAT MAKES THAT ANCHOR NOT FILL THAT NEED.

### ANCHOR UPKEEP

ANCHORS REQUIRE UPKEEP TO REMAIN. EVERY ANCHOR HAS A STATUS TRACK
REPRESENTING ITS CONDITION. AT THE START OF EACH SESSION, MARK OFF ONE
CODE FROM EVERY ANCHOR'S STATUS TRACK. COME UP WITH WHAT THIS MEANS.
FREQUENTLY, IT WILL NOT BE THE FIRST CODE MARKED FOR THAT ANCHOR, AND SO
SIMPLY REPRESENTS AN EXACERBATION. IN ADDITION, AS WITH ALL STATUS
TRACKS, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS WHICH SEEMS TO SUGGEST WORSENING OF AN
ANCHOR'S CONDITION OR CONNECTION TO YOU, MARK OFF A CODE.

UPKEEP FOR AN ANCHOR INVOLVES DOING WHATEVER IS NEEDED TO RESTORE THINGS
TO NORMAL. HOMES FREQUENTLY COST SAVINGS TO UPKEEP IN A LITERAL SENSE
(RENT, BILLS, MAINTENANCE, AND SO ON). CONNECTION ANCHORS USUALLY NEED
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU, LIKELY RECEIVING YOUR ATTENTION. MEMORIES
ANCHORS NEED TO BE KEPT FROM FADING IN YOUR MIND, OFTEN THROUGH ROUTINE
OR ROTE, AND ALSO MAY NEED PHYSICAL MAINTENANCE. IN GENERAL, PERFORMING
UPKEEP FOR AN ANCHOR TAKES A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME, OR SAVINGS, OR HAS AN
OPPORTUNITY COST, AND CLEARS THE ENTIRE STATUS TRACK, RESTORING THE
CONNECTION. NOTABLY, PERFORMING THIS UPKEEP SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT
GROUNDS YOU IN REALITY. IF YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO UPKEEP YOUR SHELTER
ANCHOR BY PERFORMING MAGIC ON IT TO TIDY EVERYTHING, YOU AREN'T
UPKEEPING THE ANCHOR, YOU MIGHT IN FACT BE SLIPPING IT. SEE THE
TRANSFORMATION SECTION LATER IN THIS CHAPTER FOR MORE EXAMPLES.

NOTE THAT AN ANCHOR'S STATUS TRACK CAN BEING SLIPPING, LIKE ANY OTHER.

#### CONNECTING WITH AN ANCHOR

WHEN YOU'VE BEEN SHAKEN BY THE THREAT OR REALITY OF BODILY HARM,
CONNECTING WITH AND ANCHOR IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR HELPING YOU GET YOUR
FEET UNDER YOU AGAIN. THIS IS JUST A LITTLE WHILE, MAYBE A COUPLE OF
MINUTES, OF REALLY REMINDING YOURSELF OF YOUR ANCHOR'S PRESENCE IN YOUR
LIFE, OR INTERACTING WITH ONE. SOME EFFECTS OF COMBAT WILL WEAR OFF
DURING THIS TIME, AND YOU CAN RECHARGE YOUR PREPARATIONS.

HOWEVER, IF AN ANCHOR'S UPKEEP STATUS TRACK IS SLIPPING (HAS HIT CODE 30
OR BELOW), THEN THERE IS NO CALM TO BE HAD. IT IS ACTIVELY DRIFTING AWAY
FROM YOU, AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH IT UNTIL THE ISSUE(S)
ARE RESOLVED.

### LOSING ANCHORS

LOSING AN ANCHOR IS A MOMENT OF TRANSFORMATION FOR YOUR CHARACTER. IT
CAN HAPPEN IN MANY WAYS, BUT ALL OF THEM MEAN THAT THE MAGE IS A LITTLE
LESS GROUNDED. THEY'RE A LITTLE CLOSER TO LEAVING BEHIND WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE HUMAN, AND A LITTLE MORE POWERFUL.

LOSING AN ANCHOR MAKES PEOPLE REACT UNPREDICTABLY. WHEN YOU LOSE AN
ANCHOR, A MOVE TRIGGERS, GIVING YOU A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENS. IF YOU'RE
LUCKY, IT IS NOT TRULY DESTABILIZING, EVEN IF IT WAS A SHOCK. IF YOU ARE
LESS LUCKY, YOU MIGHT LASH OUT, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. OR, YOU MIGHT FIND
THAT SOME OF YOUR MAGIC WAS BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAD THAT
ANCHOR TO FALL BACK ON, AND IT BACKLASHES ON YOU, WHICH MAY HAVE FURTHER
COMPOUNDING EFFECTS. OR, YOU MIGHT FIND THAT YOUR ANCHORS WERE MORE
CONNECTED THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE REALIZED, AND NOW ANOTHER ONE IS
THREATENED, OR LOST OUTRIGHT AS WELL. HOW LUCKY YOU ARE DEPENDS IN PART
ON HOW MANY ANCHORS YOU HAVE, SO YOU CAN QUICKLY ENTER INTO A SPIRAL. IF
YOUR MAGICAL EXPLOITS MEAN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SPENDING ENOUGH TIME WITH
YOUR SPOUSE AND THEY FINALLY TAKE THE KIDS AND LEAVE, YOU MIGHT REALIZE
THAT THE HOUSE REALLY ISN'T YOURS, ONCE THE DIVORCE TAKES PLACE IT WILL
BELONG TO THEM SO EVEN IN THE MEANTIME IT DOESN'T FEEL GROUNDING, AND
NOW YOU HAVE LOST TWO ANCHORS IN AS MANY MINUTES.

A FORMER ANCHOR LIKELY STILL EXISTS IN THE WORLD, AND MAY EVEN CONTINUE
TO INTERACT WITH YOU. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY AREN'T
MARKED ANYMORE. IN FACT, THE MC SHOULD PROBABLY NOTE THEM ON AN
APPROPRIATE FRONT, OR KEEP THEM IN THE HOME FRONT IF NONE STAND OUT, AS
AN ELEMENT THAT CAN STILL BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY.

#### UPKEEP

IF AN ANCHOR'S STATUS TRACK HITS CODE N, YOU HAVE LOST THEM. DEPENDING
ON THE NATURE OF THE NEEDED UPKEEP, THIS COULD MEAN MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS ABOUT THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD. YOU MIGHT GET EVICTED FROM YOUR
HOME, OR FIND THAT THE HOUSE HAS BECOME LITERALLY UNLIVABLE. A
CONNECTION ANCHOR MOST LIKELY FEELS NEGLECTED BY YOU AND DECIDES TO GO
THEIR OWN WAY. A MEMORIES ANCHOR MIGHT STOP REMINDING YOU OF WHAT IT
ONCE DID, OR IT MIGHT FINALLY BREAK, AND YOU FEEL YOUR CONNECTION TO
THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE BREAK AS WELL.

#### THREATS TO ANCHORS

A MAGE'S LIFE IS FULL OF DANGER, AND THIS CAN EXTEND TO THOSE AROUND
THEM. DURING PLAY, YOU ARE LIKELY TO DISCOVER FROM TIME TO TIME THAT AN
ANCHOR IS PUT IN REAL DANGER. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO
MAKE. YOU CAN EITHER DROP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND GO TRY TO HANDLE IT. OR,
YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT THE ANCHOR DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEAN MORE TO YOU THAN
WHAT YOU ARE DOING. OF COURSE, REALIZING THAT MEANS THAT THEY AREN'T
ANCHORING YOU ANYMORE. WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE, YOU LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE
EXPERIENCE.

WHAT EXACTLY CONSTITUTES DANGER DEPENDS ON THE ANCHOR. A BRANCH FALLING
ON YOUR HOUSE PROBABLY DEMANDS UPKEEP (MARKING A CODE OFF THE STATUS
TRACK), BUT LIKELY ISN'T AN IMMINENT DANGER. A FORECLOSURE NOTICE FROM
THE BANK, HOWEVER, REQUIRES THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE. IT MIGHT EVEN DEPEND
ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE ANCHOR. IF YOUR CONNECTION ANCHOR TELLS YOU
"SHOW UP TO THE BAR TONIGHT OR WE'RE NOT FRIENDS ANYMORE," TO ONE PERSON
THAT MIGHT BE JUST HOW THEY TALK TO THEIR BUDDY (MARK A CODE OFF THE
STATUS TRACK IF YOU STAND THEM UP), WHEREAS TO SOMEONE ELSE THAT
RELATIONSHIP IS IN REAL DANGER FROM THAT KIND OF ULTIMATUM, AND THEY
NEED TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE CHOICE.

#### NARRATIVE LOSS

SOMETIMES, IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE LOST AN ANCHOR. IF A CONNECTION
ANCHOR DIES, THEY CLEARLY ARE NO LONGER AN ANCHOR. YOU ALSO MIGHT
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR OTHER REASONS, AND ANCHOR NO LONGER FULFILLS THAT
ROLE. THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE LOSING AN ANCHOR IN ANY OTHER WAY.

##### TRANSFORMATION

ONE WAY TO LOSE AN ANCHOR IS FOR IT TO BECOME MAGICAL. ANCHORS, AFTER
ALL, CANNOT BE MAGIC AT THEIR HEARTS. IT IS OK TO PUT SOME MAGIC ON
THEM, THOUGH THIS MAY BE RISKY, AND LIKELY REQUIRES UPKEEP LATER TO HELP
RESTORE A SORT OF BALANCE. BUT, IF THEY REACH THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE
MAGICAL, THEN THEY CEASE TO BE AN ANCHOR. SOMETIMES THIS CAN HAPPEN
INTENTIONALLY, LIKE IF YOU DECIDE TO TURN YOUR HOUSE INTO A
FULLY-ENCHANTED WIZARD'S TOWER, OR YOU LINK YOUR MIND TO YOUR DOG'S
BECAUSE YOU WANT A FAMILIAR. OTHER TIMES IT MIGHT BE AN UNINTENDED SIDE
EFFECT, LIKE IF YOU SAVE YOUR SISTER BY THROWING HER INTO A MAGICAL
POOL, AND DISCOVER WHEN SHE EMERGES THAT IT NOT ONLY HEALED HER WOUNDS,
IT TRANSFORMED HER INTO AN ORACLE.

### GAINING ANCHORS

YOUR STARTING ANCHORS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES YOU CAN EVER HAVE. IT IS
POSSIBLE TO GAIN NEW ONES DURING PLAY. THESE BEHAVE EXACTLY LIKE OTHER
ANCHORS, THOUGH THEY ARE LIKELY BETTER CHARACTERIZED WHEN IT HAPPENS.
YOU CAN EVEN RE-GAIN PREVIOUSLY LOST ANCHORS, IF YOU CAN JUSTIFY IT. IT
MAY BE HELPFUL TO CONSIDER NEW ANCHORS AS ONE OF
SHELTER/CONNECTION/MEMORIES, BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED. ADD THEM TO YOUR
SHEET, AND PUT A STATUS TRACK NEXT TO THEM.

#### THROUGH A MOVE

A FEW MOVES ALLOW AN ANCHOR TO BE GAINED. WORK WITH THE MC, AND
ORIGINATOR OF THE MOVE IF NOT YOU, TO DETERMINE WHO OR WHAT THE NEW
ANCHOR IS, AND HOW YOU COME TO REALIZE WHAT THEY MEAN TO YOU.

IF YOU EXCHANGE A MOMENT OF HUMANITY WITH A GURU, YOU MAY IMMEDIATELY
GAIN AN ANCHOR. THEY ARE HIGHLY GROUNDED AS IT IS, AND THIS RUBS OFF ON
YOU. YOU CANNOT GAIN MORE ANCHORS THAN YOU STARTED WITH IN THIS WAY,
HOWEVER. THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN BE CONNECTED TO.

THE PIOUS' ADVANCED MOVE HUMANIST LETS A PIOUS SHOW YOU THE VALUE OF
HUMANITY, AND THAT CAN AFFECT YOU STRONGLY ENOUGH TO IMMEDIATELY GAIN AN
ANCHOR, EVEN GOING ABOVE YOUR STARTING NUMBER. THE PIOUS SEES SOMETHING
SPECIAL IN THE WORLD.

THE MENTOR'S ADVANCED MOVE NEKKHAMMA ALLOWS THEM TO GAIN ONE LAST
ANCHOR, "MY LOVE FOR HUMANITY", WHEN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE CEASE TO BE
ANCHORED AT ALL. THIS REPRESENTS A CERTAIN TYPE OF ENLIGHTENMENT, ONE
THAT ENCOURAGES THEM TO STICK AROUND TO SPREAD THEIR WISDOM.

#### THROUGH AN ADVANCEMENT

ALL PLAYBOOKS ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO GAIN AN ANCHOR AS ONE OF THEIR
TIER 1 UNLIMITED ADVANCEMENTS. THIS WILL LIST A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
ANCHORS YOU CAN HAVE AFTER TAKING THIS ADVANCEMENT HOWEVER, AND IT IS
ALWAYS ONE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF ANCHORS YOUR PLAYBOOK CAN START WITH.
THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO REGAIN SOME GROUND IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE EDGE,
BUT CAN'T BRING YOU BACK TO AS FULLY GROUNDED AS YOU STARTED OUT.

### NON PLAYER CHARACTER MAGES

IN THIS WORLD, MAGES HAVE ANCHORS. MCS SHOULD BE SURE TO THINK ABOUT
THIS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEIR NPC MAGES. LOSING EVEN A SINGLE ANCHOR
WILL LIKELY HIT AN NPC EXTREMELY HARD, MUCH LIKE NPCS OFTEN ONLY TAKE 1
OR 2 HARM BEFORE GOING DOWN FOR THE COUNT.

INSPIRATIONS
------------

THE COUNTERPART TO ANCHORS, INSPIRATIONS ARE WHAT BRING A MAGE THEIR
POWER, OR TEMPT THEM TO CROSS THE LINE TO BEING SOMETHING OTHER THAN
HUMAN. OTHER MAGES OFTEN INSPIRE, AND PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT SPIRITS,
ANIMALS, OR EVEN MAGICAL OBJECTS MIGHT AS WELL. WHERE ANCHORS KEEP YOU
TIED TO THE PHYSICAL REALITY, INSPIRATIONS HELP YOU FIND WAYS TO RISE
ABOVE YOUR MUNDANE EXISTENCE. THEY HELP YOU STRIVE TO REACH YOUR TRUE
POTENTIAL, BUT IN THAT STRIVING, IS IT POSSIBLE YOU WILL GO TOO FAR?
INSPIRATIONS ARE ALWAYS INHERENTLY MAGICAL, WHETHER THEY BE OTHER
AWAKENED MAGES, SPIRITS, OR MAGICAL OBJECTS, IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HELP
YOU TRANSCEND THE CONSTRAINTS OF YOUR MAGICAL CAPABILITIES, THEY MUST
THEMSELVES BE PART OF THE MAGICAL WORLD. (OF COURSE, SOMETIMES YOU MEET
SOMEONE WHO WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE AN INSPIRATION IF ONLY THEY KNEW LIKE
YOU DID, THAT MAGIC WAS REAL. MAYBE YOU START SEARCHING FOR A WAY TO
REALLY OPEN THEIR EYES, THINKING ABOUT HOW PERFECT EVERYTHING WILL BE
THEN.)

### GAINING INSPIRATIONS

WHILE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE, SPIRITS, ANIMALS OR EVEN ITEMS THAT COULD
SERVE TO INSPIRE YOU, ONLY SOME OF THEM ARE ACTIVELY ON YOUR MIND AT A
GIVEN TIME. WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH SOMEONE OR SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES
YOUR MAGIC IN CERTAIN SPECIAL WAYS, THEY BECOME AN ACTIVE INSPIRATION
FOR YOU, LIFTING YOU TO NEW HEIGHTS.

#### HAVING A MOMENT OF HUMANITY

THE FIRST WAY OF GAINING (OR RE-GAINING) AN INSPIRATION IS TO HAVE A
MOMENT OF HUMANITY WITH ANOTHER MAGE. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, ALONG WITH
ROLLING YOUR MOVE, YOU MAY ADD THEM AS AN INSPIRATION. WRITE THEIR NAME
DOWN ON YOUR PLAYBOOK ALONG WITH MAYBE A NOTE ABOUT HOW THEY INSPIRE YOU
TO GREATER MAGICAL FEATS, LIKE "REMINDS ME TO THINK OF INDIVIDUALS, NOT
JUST GROUPS" OR "SHOWS ME NEW FORMS OF MAGIC EVERY TIME WE MEET."

#### DOING MAGIC THROUGH THEM

THE SECOND WAY OF GAINING (OR RE-GAINING) AN INSPIRATION IS TO ACTIVELY
WORK YOUR MAGIC THROUGH, OR IN DEEP COLLABORATION WITH, THEM OR IT. THIS
IS MORE COMMONLY A WAY TO GAIN AN INSPIRATION THAT ISN'T ANOTHER PERSON,
BE IT A SPIRIT, A FAMILIAR, A MAGICAL FOCUS, OR SIMILAR. WHEN YOU DO
MAGIC THROUGH ONE OF THESE THINGS, OR EVEN THROUGH ANOTHER MAGE, YOU MAY
ADD THEM AS AN INSPIRATION. WRITE THEM DOWN ON YOUR PLAYBOOK ALONG WITH
MAYBE A NOTE ABOUT HOW THEY INSPIRE YOU TO GREATER MAGICAL HEIGHTS, LIKE
"CONTAINS THE SECRETS OF BLOOD MAGIC" OR "TELLS ME WHAT'S WRONG IN MY
CODE."

### MAINTAINING INSPIRATIONS

INSPIRATION IS SOMETIMES SAID TO BE FLEETING. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR
CONNECTION WITH YOUR INSPIRATIONS, SIMPLY DO THE SAME THING YOU MIGHT DO
TO GAIN ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF YOU DO SO ONCE PER SESSION PER
INSPIRATION, THEY'LL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE YOU.

### LOSING INSPIRATIONS (AND WHY IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL)

LOSING AN INSPIRATION, MORE LIKELY JUST FALLING OUT OF TOUCH AND NOT
HAVING THEM AT THE FOREFRONT OF YOUR THOUGHTS, ISN'T A BIG DEAL. THERE'S
NO PENALTY, AND YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND REKINDLE THAT SPARK OF
INSPIRATION. IF AT THE END OF A SESSION YOU HAVE NOT HAD A MOMENT OF
HUMANITY WITH OR DONE MAGIC THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF YOUR INSPIRATIONS,
JUST ERASE THEM FROM YOUR SHEET AND KEEP ON KEEPING ON.

### NON-HUMAN INSPIRATIONS

MOST INSPIRATIONS ARE OTHER HUMANS, ESPECIALLY THE OTHER MAGES PLAYED AT
THE TABLE. BUT, THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOURCE. MAGIC ITSELF CAN
BE INSPIRING, AND IT TAKES MANY FORMS. INSPIRATIONS REALLY CAN BE ANY
MAGICAL THING THAT MAKE SENSE AT YOUR TABLE, BUT A FEW ARE WORTH CALLING
OUT EXPLICITLY.

FAMILIAR SPIRITS ARE A CLASSIC PART OF MAGICAL LORE. WIZARDS CONSTRUCT
HOMOCULI TO HELP THEM AROUND THE LABORATORY. WITCHES BOND WITH MAGICAL
CATS. IN THESE CASES, THE MAGICAL BEING ITSELF USUALLY ELEVATES THE
MAGE, POSSIBLY EVEN SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THEM ON ISSUES OF MAGIC.
WHETHER A FAMILIAR IS A SPIRIT TAKING AN UNDERSTANDABLE FORM OR IS A
FORMERLY MUNDANE ANIMAL WHICH HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING MORE
IS ACADEMIC.

SOME MAGES BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE A PERSONAL SPIRIT WHO HELPS GUIDE THEM
ON THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS ENLIGHTENMENT. THIS SPIRIT MAY APPEAR IN DREAMS
AND VISIONS, AND LIKELY OFFERS TANTALIZING, INCOMPLETE CLUES ABOUT
MAGIC. ON LUCKY OCCASIONS, THE MAGE MIGHT GET A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY TALK
DIRECTLY TO THE SPIRIT, AND MAY GET A SENSE OF A FAVORITE MANIFESTATION,
SUCH AS A MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURE, FORCE OF NATURE, OR EVEN A PAST LIFE.
THESE SPIRITS ARE OFTEN CALLED AVATARS, OR GENIUS, AND THEY CAN BE A
POWERFUL SOURCE OF INSPIRATION IF INTERACTED WITH REGULARLY.

SOME MAGICAL ITEMS ARE SIMPLY TOOLS, BUT OTHERS GO BEYOND THAT.
IMPORTANT RELICS A MAGE HAS FOUND, OR ARTIFACTS THEY CREATED THEMSELVES,
CAN CONTINUE TO INSPIRE. DOING MAGIC FROM AN ANCIENT SPELLBOOK JUST
FEELS DIFFERENT FROM PIECING THE COMPONENTS TOGETHER OUT OF POP
WITCHCRAFT, AND SOMETIMES A WAND CHOOSES A WIZARD.

TETHERED AND UNTETHERED
-----------------------

### BEING TETHERED

BEING TETHERED IS A STATE THAT ALL MAGES FIND THEMSELVES IN AT THE START
OF A GAME OF CONSENSUS. IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT YOU HAVE AT LEAST AS MANY
ANCHORS AS YOU HAVE INSPIRATIONS, AND IT IS A SAFE PLACE TO BE. SAFE,
BUT POTENTIALLY UNFULFILLING, YOU CAN'T REACH YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL WHILE
TETHERED, YOU CAN'T WORK YOUR WILL ON REALITY WHEN YOU LET YOURSELF BE
TETHERED TO REALITY.

### BECOMING UNTETHERED

ONCE YOU HAVE MORE INSPIRATIONS THAN ANCHORS, YOU BECOME UNTETHERED, A
MAGE TRULY STARTING TO GRASP JUST HOW FAR THEIR POWER CAN REACH. MORE
PATHS WILL OPEN UP TO YOU WHILE YOU ARE UNTETHERED, BUT BEWARE, YOU
STAND ON A PRECIPICE, EVEN MORE THAN YOU DID BEFORE.

WHEN YOU LOSE INSPIRATIONS, OR GAIN ANCHORS SO THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER
UNTETHERED, YOU GO BACK TO BEING TETHERED, BUT YOU KEEP ANY ADVANCEMENTS
YOU MAY HAVE GAINED WHILE UNTETHERED.

### UNTETHERED ADVANCEMENTS

THE TOP TIER OF ADVANCEMENTS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE WHILE YOUR PC IS
UNTETHERED. THESE ADVANCEMENTS ARE OFTEN MORE POWERFUL THAN OTHERS YOU
HAVE ACCESS TO, SO YOU WILL NEED TO DECIDE IF THE POWER IS WORTH THE
RISK. NOTE THAT WHEN YOU GAIN AN ADVANCEMENT, YOU MUST TAKE IT
IMMEDIATELY, SO IF YOU ARE COMING UP ON YOUR 6TH ADVANCEMENT AND REALLY
WANT TO ACCESS YOUR UNTETHERED ADVANCEMENTS IMMEDIATELY, IT IS TIME TO
START GAINING INSPIRATIONS, OR SHEDDING ANCHORS.

#### ADVANCED MOVES

NOTABLY, THE ONLY WAY TO ACCESS YOUR PLAYBOOK'S ADVANCED MOVES IS BY
BEING UNTETHERED, AT LEAST FOR A TIME.

### BASIC MOVE EFFECTS

CERTAIN MOVES CARE IF YOUR CHARACTER IS TETHERED, OR HOW MANY ANCHORS OR
INSPIRATIONS YOUR CHARACTER HAS. ASSERTING YOUR PARADIGM AND IMPRESSING
NON-MAGE MAGICAL BEINGS ARE BOTH SLIGHTLY HARDER IF YOU ARE TETHERED. ON
THE OTHER HAND, WHEN YOU ROLL TO HELP OR HINDER ANOTHER PC, YOU ROLL
+ANCHORS, EVEN IF YOU ARE HELPING OR HINDERING A MAGICAL EFFECT.

### LOSING A CHARACTER

IF YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF WITH INSPIRATIONS TOTALING MORE THAN TWICE THE
NUMBER OF ANCHORS YOU HAVE REMAINING, THAT'S THE MOMENT YOU'VE TAKEN A
LOOK TO SEE WHERE THE LINE IS, THE ONE THAT MAGES CAN'T STEP OVER AND
MAINTAIN THEIR HUMANITY, AND YOU NOTICE THAT IT'S A FEW STEPS BEHIND
YOU. THIS CHARACTER WILL BE WRAPPING UP, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WHEN YOU
LOSE AN ANCHOR OR GAIN AN INSPIRATION THAT WOULD PUT YOU OVER THIS
THRESHOLD, YOU LOSE THE CHARACTER. THEY BECOME SOMETHING OTHER THAN
HUMAN. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE, A CHARACTER MIGHT
DESCEND INTO A MAGIC-FUELED RAGE FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY, OR THEY MIGHT
THROW OFF THE SHACKLES OF THEIR EARTHLY FORM AND ASCEND TO A HIGHER
CONSCIOUSNESS, JUST FOR A COUPLE EXAMPLES. WORK WITH THE MC TO DETERMINE
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CHARACTER, AND THEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER
CHARACTERS TO PLAY, GRAB A PLAYBOOK AND MAKE A NEW ONE. THE MC WILL
ALMOST CERTAINLY BRING YOUR "LOST" CHARACTER BACK IN SOME WAY THROUGH
THE STORY, SO EVERYONE CAN INTERACT WITH... WHATEVER THEY HAVE BECOME.

\newpage

GEAR AND ACCOUTREMENTS
======================

GEAR
----

GEAR COVERS NOTABLE POSSESSIONS. THIS IS THE MODERN WORLD, SO THERE ARE
LOTS OF TRIVIAL OR COMMON ITEMS THAT DON'T GET MENTIONED OFTEN: YOU
PROBABLY HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES, COULD CARRY A PEN, MAY HAVE A FLASHLIGHT
AND SO ON. YOU MAY BE LIKELY TO HAVE A CELLPHONE, DEPENDING ON WHERE AND
WHEN YOUR STORY IS SET, AND THE CHARACTERS' SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THESE
AREN'T CALLED OUT ANYWHERE ON YOUR CHARACTER SHEET. THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY DON'T EXIST, OF COURSE. YOU MIGHT USE THEM AS PART OF A MOVE, AND
SOME MC MOVES MIGHT MEAN THAT IT TURNS OUT YOUR WALLET FELL OUT OF YOUR
POCKET AND YOU ONLY NOTICE AT THE WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT. DETERMINE
TOGETHER, AS A TABLE, WHAT IS NORMAL TO EXPECT PEOPLE TO HAVE (A GAME
ABOUT WORKING IN AN ANTARCTIC BASE IS GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT
ASSUMPTIONS FROM ONE ABOUT BEING DEEP IN THE CITY). YOU ALSO MIGHT WANT
TO HAVE IT BE NOTEWORTHY THAT YOUR CHARACTER LACKS ONE OR MORE EXPECTED
MODERN-DAY ITEMS. BUT, IN GENERAL, DON'T STRESS ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MANY
SOCKS YOUR CHARACTER HAS.

HOWEVER, SOME THINGS ARE INTERESTING BY THEIR NATURE, AND MOST EVERYONE
HAS ITEMS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEM, AND SHOW SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR
PREPARATION, OR SENTIMENTALITY. THIS IS LISTED UNDER GEAR ON YOUR
CHARACTER SHEET, AND YOU SELECT IT FROM LISTS DURING CHARACTER CREATION.

STARTING GEAR IS LISTED IN CATEGORIES, FROM WITHIN WHICH YOU CHOOSE.
THINK ABOUT WHY YOUR CHARACTER HAPPENS TO HAVE THAT, WHAT IT MEANS, AND
HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE USED IT ALREADY. MENTION IT TO THE OTHER PLAYERS,
TOO, SINCE IT MIGHT SPARK IDEAS FOR THEM.

NOTE THAT STARTING GEAR ALSO DOESN'T COVER SOME OTHER POSSESSIONS, LIKE
WHERE YOU LIVE, OR ITEMS THAT ARE ANCHORS. HOMES ARE PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT (SEE THE [ANCHORS CHAPTER](AnchorsChapter)), AND HAVING ONE TO
LIVE IN USUALLY MEANS IT IS AN ANCHOR, UNLESS SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAS
HAPPENED. FOR OTHER ANCHORS, THOUGH, IF THEY REPRESENT SOMETHING THAT
WOULD GENERALLY NEED TO BE CALLED OUT IN GEAR, LIKE A GUN OR A
MOTORCYCLE, THEN THEY NEED TO ALSO BE LISTED UNDER GEAR OR ELSE THEY ARE
SENTIMENTAL, BUT NOT FUNCTIONAL. STARTING ANCHORS AND STARTING GEAR
SHOULD USUALLY HAVE AN OPTION THAT ALLOWS THEM TO LINE UP IN THIS WAY.
NOTHING STOPS YOU FROM CHOOSING ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER, OF COURSE. MAYBE
THE MOTORCYCLE IS JUST A MOTORCYCLE, NOTHING SPECIAL, AND MAYBE THE
PISTOL THAT KEEPS YOU ANCHORED TO THE MEMORY OF YOUR FATHER HAD ITS
BARREL WELDED SHUT WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD, AS A FORM OF PROTEST.

WHEN YOU MAKE OR ACQUIRE A NEW ITEM OF SIGNIFICANCE, EITHER THROUGH
NORMAL PLAY OR THROUGH A MOVE SUCH AS UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMER, MAKE SURE TO
WRITE IT ON YOUR PLAYBOOK UNDER THE GEAR SECTION. SOMETIMES THIS COULD
BE AS SIMPLE AS TELLING THE MC YOU'D LIKE TO BUY SOMETHING.

### SAVINGS

MONEY IS HARD TO DEAL WITH. IN SOME GAMES, IT MAKES SENSE TO SIMPLY KEEP
TRACK OF GOLD COINS AS THEY COME AND GO. THE MODERN WORLD IS MORE
COMPLICATED. IN SMALL GROUPS, SYSTEMS OF FAVORS AND MUTUAL
INTERDEPENDENCE OFTEN OVERSHADOW MONEY. IN ADDITION, THE EXISTENCE OF
SECONDHAND SHOPS, EBAY, AND BARGAIN HUNTING MEAN THAT YOU CAN OFTEN FIND
SOMETHING WITHIN YOUR PRICE RANGE, AS LONG AS YOU AREN'T TOO PICKY.

TO REPRESENT THIS, MONEY IN CONSENSUS IS HANDLED ABSTRACTLY. PRICES ARE
GIVEN AS A NUMBER OF SAVINGS THAT HAVE TO BE SPENT. IMPORTANTLY, THIS
NUMBER OF SAVINGS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ROUGHLY THE SAME FOR DIFFERENT
CHARACTERS, BUT THE DETAILS AND QUALITY OF THE GOOD OR SERVICE WILL
DEPEND ON THE CHARACTER'S IN-FICTION WEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE, "A NICE MEAL
FOR TWO" IS LISTED AS ONE SAVING. THE DIFFERENCE IS, IF THOSE TWO WORK
MINIMUM WAGE JOBS, IT MIGHT BE A MEAL AT THEIR FAVORITE CHAIN THAT
INCLUDES DESSERT. IF THEY ARE A MOVIE STAR AND AN
INTERNATIONALLY-FEATURED ARTIST, IT'S PROBABLY A CUSTOM CREATION BY A
PERSONAL CHEF. WHEN BUYING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH WHAT
WOULD BE NORMAL FOR THE CHARACTER, THE MC WILL ADJUST SAVINGS AS IS
APPROPRIATE. AND, SOMETHING THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE
1-SAVINGS CATEGORY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T COST THE CHARACTER ANYTHING AT
ALL. HOWEVER, DO REMEMBER THAT BUYING A LOT OF SOMETHING CAN ADD UP.
WHEN PRICING SOMETHING NEW, LOOK TO THIS TABLE TO GET A GENERAL SENSE.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
1 SAVING
</td>
<td>
A NICE MEAL FOR TWO. A SUIT. A THOUGHTFUL GIFT. AN INTERSTATE TRAIN
TICKET. A GOOD PSYCHIC READING.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2 SAVINGS
</td>
<td>
AN OSTENTATIOUS MEAL FOR TWO. A DOMESTIC PLANE TICKET. A HANDGUN. A
COMPUTER. A NIGHT'S STAY AT A HOTEL. A RARE BOOK. WALK-IN MEDICAL
TREATMENT.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3 SAVINGS
</td>
<td>
A SHORT HOSPITAL STAY. A COLLEGE COURSE. A SHORT VACATION. A
CUSTOM-CRAFTED SWORD, MADE BY A SKILLED CRAFTSPERSON.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4 SAVINGS
</td>
<td>
A CAR, A MOTORCYCLE, A BOAT
</td>
</tr>
</table>

SOMETIMES, THE MC WILL SAY THAT A COURSE OF ACTION REQUIRES SOME SAVINGS
TO BE SPENT. THIS CAN FREQUENTLY HAPPEN AS PART OF UPKEEP FOR ANCHORS,
PARTICULARLY THE SHELTER ANCHOR. FINALLY, REMEMBER THAT SOME THINGS
CANNOT BE BOUGHT FOR ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY, AND WILL HAVE TO BE PROCURED
THROUGH OTHER MEANS.

CHARACTERS HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SAVINGS, BEGINNING WITH THE AMOUNT
LISTED UNDER THEIR STARTING GEAR. SUBTRACT FROM THIS WHEN TOLD TO,
USUALLY SPENDING OR UPKEEP. THE MC MAY ALSO TELL CHARACTERS TO INCREASE
THEIR SAVINGS, SUCH AS WHEN GETTING PAID FOR A JOB, OR FINDING SOMETHING
VALUABLE THAT IS THEN SOLD. A STEADY JOB CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR A MAGE TO
KEEP UP, HOWEVER, IT DOES SOMEWHAT GUARANTEE A SUPPLY OF SAVINGS, WHICH
CAN BE WORTH IT. THE MC SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT OF STAYING
OUT ALL NIGHT TO FIGHT THE LIVING DEAD ON SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO OPEN THE
SHOP IN THE MORNING.

OF COURSE, A MAGE WHO SHAPES REALITY TO THEIR WHIMS CAN DECIDE THAT
MONEY IS A PROBLEM FOR OTHER PEOPLE, AND SEEK TO CIRCUMVENT IT WITH
MAGIC. IF THEY AREN'T CHANGING A BARTENDER'S MIND TO ADD IT TO THEIR TAB
JUST THIS ONE MORE TIME, THEY MIGHT HAVE THE \$20 THEY NEED BLOW IN ON A
DUST DEVIL, OR WIN A SMALL LOTTERY, OR GO DIGGING FOR BURIED TREASURE IN
THEIR BACKYARD AND, INCREDIBLY, FIND A CHEST OF PIRATE GOLD. THIS DOES
HAVE ALL THE USUAL PARADOXICAL DANGERS OF REPEATED COINCIDENCE, OF
COURSE. IT IS MUCH MORE HARMONIOUS TO CHANGE THINGS UP, THAN TO KEEP
DIGGINGS HOLES IN YOUR YARD UNTIL THE CONSENSUS SITS UP AND TAKES
NOTICE.

ACCOUTREMENTS
-------------

SOME PLAYBOOKS HAVE EXTRA SECTIONS THAT INCLUDE HOW THEY RELATE TO THE
WORLD. ONLY FILL IN THESE SECTIONS IF YOU SELECT OR START WITH THE MOVE
THAT IS ATTACHED TO THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, A PIOUS ONLY FILLS OUT THEIR
PLACE OF POWER ONCE THEY SELECT THE SANCTUARY MOVE, WHEREAS A CABALIST
STARTS WITH THE MOVE GOSSAMER THREADS, AND FILLS OUT THE CABAL SECTION
OF THEIR PLAYBOOK WHEN MAKING THE CHARACTER.

### PLACES OF POWER

PLACES OF POWER ARE MAGICALLY SIGNIFICANT SITES, AND FOR A PC TO HAVE
ACCESS TO ONE IS A BIG DEAL. IF YOU TAKE A MOVE THAT GIVES YOU ACCESS TO
A PLACE OF POWER, YOU WILL FAIRLY RELIABLY HAVE ACCESS TO SOMEWHERE TO
DO RITUALS, WHICH ALLOW FOR MUCH LARGER EFFECTS THAN NORMAL. EACH PLACE
OF POWER HAS SEVERAL SECTIONS TO FILL OUT.

#### FACADE

THIS IS THE APPEARANCE THAT THE PLACE TAKES ON, OR THE STRUCTURE BUILT
OVER AND AROUND IT. THESE ARE BOTH THEMATIC AND PRACTICAL, AND THE
FACADE YOU CHOOSE WILL HELP INFORM MANY OF THE OTHER CHOICES WHILE
MAKING THE PLACE OF POWER. THIS IS ALSO WHEN YOU WILL WORK WITH THE MC
TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF YOUR PLACE OF POWER.

#### STRENGTHS

THESE REPRESENT THE UPSIDES TO THE PARTICULAR PLACE YOU HAVE CHOSEN.
WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE, MAKE SURE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT
MEANS TO YOU, SO THE MC DOESN'T ACCIDENTALLY CIRCUMVENT IT. (THEY MAY OF
COURSE PURPOSELY CIRCUMVENT IT WHEN THEIR MOVES ALLOW THEM TO.)

#### WEAKNESSES

THESE REPRESENT THE DOWNSIDES TO YOUR PLACE OF POWER. AGAIN, TALK A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHICH ONES YOU CHOOSE AND WHAT THEY MEAN TO YOU, AND
WHAT THEY MEAN FOR THE PLACE OF POWER. IF A PLACE OF POWER IS
INACCESSIBLE, WHY, WHAT MAKES IT HARD TO GET TO? IF IT'S TAINTED, BY
WHAT? HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE MAGIC THAT'S CAST THERE? YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DECIDE EVERYTHING RIGHT AWAY, BUT THE MC WILL LIKELY MAKE PROBING
QUESTIONS AT THE WEAKNESSES, TO HELP EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL
RISKS OF THAT PLACE OF POWER.

#### RITUAL BONUS

THIS CHOICE IS A BONUS TO THE RITUAL MOVE WHEN IT IS PERFORMED AT THIS
PLACE OF POWER. THIS REALLY HELPS SOLIDIFY THE UNIQUENESS OF YOUR PLACE
OF POWER, WHICH CAN BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF MULTIPLE PLAYBOOKS ARE IN
PLAY WITH A PLACE OF POWER MOVE. THIS LIMITS THE POTENTIAL COSTS, NEEDS,
OR DOWNSIDES OF DOING A RITUAL HERE.

### OTHER ACCOUTREMENTS

#### THE CABALIST'S CABAL

THE CABALIST HAS A GROUP OF LIKE-MINDED MAGES THAT THEY WORK WITH
REGULARLY. THOUGH THEY ARE REPRESENTED AS A GROUP ON YOUR PLAYBOOK, WORK
WITH THE MC TO MAKE THEM EACH INDIVIDUALS. THE MC WILL LIKELY ASK
PROBING QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM AS THEY APPEAR IN THE STORY, AND SHOULD TIE
THEIR STORIES TO OTHER PLAYER CHARACTERS AS WELL. YOUR CABAL AS A WHOLE
HAS STRENGTHS AND A VULNERABILITY. THESE HELP ADD DEPTH TO THE GROUP,
AND ALSO TELL THE MC WHAT KINDS OF STORIES AND SITUATIONS YOU WANT TO
PLAY OUT WITH YOUR CABAL, AND WHAT KINDS YOU WANT TO AVOID.

##### EXAMPLE CABAL

THE CHI BETA CHI BOOK CLUB SECRET SOCIETY -

THE BOOK CLUB HAS ALUMNI THAT GRADUATED PREVIOUSLY AND OTHER CHAPTERS ON
OTHER CAMPUSES WITH THEIR OWN CABALS. +SUPPORT

THE BOOK CLUB HAS STUDIED MAGIC AND HAS PASSED DOWN TECHNIQUES FROM
SENIOR TO FRESHMAN. DROP WEAK MAGIC.

THE FRAT LIKES TO THROW PARTIES AND THE BOOK CLUB DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
THE MEANING OF SUBTLE. VULNERABLE: TARGET

#### THE GURU'S STUDENTS

THE GURU HAS A GROUP OF MUNDANE STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE TEACHING. EACH
SESSION THEY PROGRESS TOWARDS THEIR WANT OR THEIR SURPLUS OR BOTH. WHEN
THEY REACH A TIPPING POINT, THE MC WILL HAVE THEM EITHER HELP OUT IN A
WAY RELATED TO THE SURPLUS, OR CAUSE PROBLEMS BY PURSUING THEIR WANT OR
WANTS. THE STUDENTS ARE ALSO INDIVIDUALS, WHO CAN BE CONNECTED TO OTHER
PLAYER CHARACTERS. WHILE THEY OFTEN ACT TOGETHER AS A GROUP, THEY ALSO
ACT AS INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR OWN PERSONALITIES.

##### EXAMPLE STUDENTS

SHADY GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL GO CLUB -

THE GO CLUB IS FULL OF BRIGHT STUDENTS WHO ALL WANT TO PLAY FIRST TABLE
AT ANY UPCOMING MATCH, AND TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO PROVE THEMSELVES.
(REPLACE WANT: DEPARTURE WITH WANT: COMPETITION)

THE GO CLUB IS FULL OF MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WHO ARE PENNED UP IN CLASSROOMS
FOR FAR TOO MUCH OF THE DAY, BUT THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE PLAYING AND
LEARNING THE GAME. (REPLACE SURPLUS: TIME WITH SURPLUS: ENERGY)

THE STUDENTS ARE QUICK STUDIES, ALWAYS TRYING OUT NEW THINGS AND
ADAPTING STRATEGIES ON THE FLY. (+1 LEARNING)

#### THE INSPIRED'S SOURCE

THE INSPIRED'S SOURCE IS A RELIABLE INSPIRATION FOR THEM, WHEN THEY CAN
GET IT. IT HAS A FORM THAT DESCRIBES IT, ONE POSITIVE TAG, AND TWO
NEGATIVE TAGS. REALLY FLESH OUT WHAT THE SOURCE IS THOUGH, THE TAGS
SHOULD JUST DESCRIBE IT. THE POSITIVE TAG CAN BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHILE
INTERACTING WITH YOUR SOURCE, AND THE MC CAN USE THE NEGATIVE TAGS TO
AFFECT YOU (OR YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS YOUR SOURCE.)

##### EXAMPLE SOURCES

MUSE - A PERSON, +SENSE, +QUICK, +CHAOTIC

PEAK EXPERIENCES - AN ACTION, +ALERT, +RARE, +FORBIDDEN

ADRENALINE - AN ACTION, +INVIGORATING, +DANGEROUS, +ADDICTING

A PATRON ELDRITCH HORROR - AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT, +SENSE, +DANGEROUS,
+CHAOTIC

INTENSE EMOTIONAL MUSIC - AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT, +SAFE, +QUICK, +RARE

A VERY SPECIAL BOULDER I KEEP IN MY BASEMENT - AN OBJECT, +SAFE,
+IMMOBILE, +RARE

AN ORNATELY CARVED STATUE WITH SHARP EDGES - AN OBJECT, +SOCIAL,
+DANGEROUS, +RARE

TERROR - AN EMOTION, +SOCIAL, +FORBIDDEN, +DANGEROUS

### TAGS

TAGS ARE NARRATIVE FLAGS APPLIED TO SOME ACCOUTREMENTS. THEY ARE ONE OR
TWO WORDS WRITTEN WITH A + IN FRONT TO MAKE THEM STAND OUT. WHEN YOU ARE
TOLD TO SELECT TAGS, YOU ARE ADDING CUSTOMIZATION AND MAKING THE
ACCOUTREMENT CONCRETE. THEY CAN DEFINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, AND
OTHER RELEVANT PROPERTIES. TAGS OFTEN COME WITH A SMALL DESCRIPTION TO
HELP FLESH OUT THE MEANING. THE PLAYER AND THE MC SHOULD BOTH NOTE THE
TAGS, TO MAKE IT EASY TO BRING THEM UP OFTEN. TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
MAY BOTH HAVE A PLACE OF POWER, BUT IF ONE HAS THE STRENGTH TAG
+PRIVATE, AND THE OTHER HAS THE STRENGTH TAG +FAMOUS, THEN THE
INTERACTIONS AT EACH SHOULD BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THE FIRST IS UNLIKELY
TO HAVE RITUALS BE INTERRUPTED BY PASSERS-BY, WHILE THE SECOND MIGHT
CAUSE MORE HELPFUL CHANCE MEETINGS.

LIKE MOST THINGS IN CONSENSUS, TAGS ARE PRESCRIPTIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE. IF
THE +PRIVATE PLACE OF POWER BECOMES FAMOUS, ITS STRENGTH SHOULD PROBABLY
CHANGE. LIKEWISE, IF AN ADVANCEMENT ALLOWS A NEW TAG TO BE ADDED,
DESCRIBE WHAT HAS CHANGED TO MAKE THIS TRUE.

\newpage

IMPROVEMENT
===========

CHARACTERS GROW AND CHANGE THROUGH THE COURSE OF A STORY. MAGES ARE NO
DIFFERENT. THEY LEARN NEW TYPES OF MAGIC, GET STRONGER, AND SOMETIMES
CHANGE WHO THEY ARE ENTIRELY. EXPERIENCE IS THE PRIMARY METHOD OF
TRACKING HOW THIS HAPPENS OVER THE COURSE OF A CAMPAIGN, BUT IT IS NOT
THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGES. GROWTH CAN COME IN QUICK, NOTEWORTHY JUMPS,
OR EVOLVE SLOWLY OVER TIME, ONLY TO BE NOTICED AFTER A WHILE. THUS,
THESE CHANGES CAN BE MADE AT ANY TIME THAT THEY MAKE SENSE DURING A
SESSION.

GAINING EXPERIENCE
------------------

EXPERIENCE IS A MEASURE OF HOW YOUR CHARACTER GROWS AND LEARNS OVER
TIME. IN CONSENSUS, "MARKING EXPERIENCE" REFERS TO FILLING IN A BUBBLE
ON YOUR CHARACTER SHEET. WHEN YOU FILL IN THE FIFTH BUBBLE, ERASE THEM
ALL AND PICK AN ADVANCEMENT.

SEVERAL THINGS CAUSE YOU TO MARK EXPERIENCE. GENERALLY, LIKE THE REST OF
CONSENSUS, DO IT WHEN A MOVE TELLS YOU TO. THE WAYS YOU CAN MARK
EXPERIENCE ARE COMMON INFORMATION AT THE TABLE, AND CAN ACT AS
ENCOURAGEMENT: IF YOU LET THE HEDGE MAGE TALK TO YOUR CHARACTER ABOUT
THEIR PARADIGM, YOU JUST MIGHT MARK EXPERIENCE! EVERYBODY WINS!
SIMILARLY, YOU CAN USE HOLD FROM MOVES LIKE ASSERT YOUR PARADIGM. THIS
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO, BY
OFFERING EXPERIENCE.

HERE ARE MOST COMMON WAYS TO MARK EXPERIENCE, WHICH REFLECT HOW
CONSENSUS IS ENCOURAGING YOU TO PLAY THE GAME.

### FLAGS

EVERY CHARACTER IN PLAY SHOULD HAVE A FLAG. WHEN YOU HIT A FLAG FOR A
CHARACTER THAT YOU HAVEN'T HIT BEFORE, MARK EXPERIENCE. THIS WILL GIVE
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE IT, AND YOU CAN'T MARK EXPERIENCE FOR
HITTING THAT SAME FLAG AGAIN. EVEN A MINOR CHANGE IS ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOU
TO MARK EXPERIENCE AGAIN, HOWEVER. FLAGS ARE A WAY TO TELL THE OTHER
PLAYERS HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR CHARACTER INTERACTED WITH, AND
OFFER THEM A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN RETURN IF THEY DO IT.

### ASSERTING YOUR PARADIGM

IF SOMEONE ASSERTS THEIR PARADIGM OVER YOU, AND ROLLS A SUCCESS, ONE OF
THE THINGS THEY CAN SPEND THEIR HOLD TO DO IS CAUSE YOU TO MARK
EXPERIENCE. THE PLAYER IS PERFECTLY WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO USE THIS AS A
BRIBE: "IF YOU GO ALONG WITH MY CHARACTER'S WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS,
I'LL LET YOU MARK EXPERIENCE." IN-GAME, THIS REPRESENTS YOUR CHARACTER
SEEING SOMETHING IN THEIR ASSERTION, AND MAYBE LEARNING FROM IT.

### AN ANCHOR IS PUT IN DANGER

WHEN ONE OF YOUR ANCHORS IS PUT IN DANGER, MARK EXPERIENCE RIGHT AWAY.
NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S A CAUSE OF GROWTH. WHETHER THE DANGER LEADS YOU TO
FIND OUT HOW FAR YOU'RE WILLING TO GO TO PROTECT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO
YOU, OR MAKES YOU REALIZE YOU DIDN'T CARE THAT MUCH AFTER ALL, OR EVEN
JUST REMINDS YOU OF THE PRECIOUS AND FLEETING NATURE OF THINGS, IT ADDS
TO YOUR EXPERIENCE.

### AT END OF SESSION

AT THE END OF EVERY SESSION, A MOVE TRIGGERS TO RESOLVE DANGLING
THREADS, BUT ALSO ASKS THE TABLE A SET OF QUESTIONS. IF ANYONE ANSWERS
YES TO A QUESTION, EVERYONE MARKS EXPERIENCE (FOR ANY CHARACTERS THEY
PLAYED DURING THE SESSION). IT IS REASONABLE TO DISCUSS WHETHER AN EVENT
THAT OCCURRED MEANS A QUESTION IS ANSWERED YES, BUT EVEN IF THE ANSWER
WAS ONLY RELEVANT FOR SOME CHARACTERS, IT COUNTS FOR EVERYONE. FOR
EXAMPLE, IF LESLIE UNCOVERED THE SECRET OF THE UNTOUCHED WORDS WHILE
CORY AND ASH SPENT THE WHOLE SESSION ARGUING OVER HERB GARDENS, ALL
THREE STILL MARK EXPERIENCE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO GAIN THE MOST
EXPERIENCE, AND ALSO HELPS YOU CHECK THE TONE OF YOUR GAME AFTER EACH
SESSION. IF YOU FIND THAT FOR MULTIPLE SESSIONS IN A ROW, YOU DON'T
ANSWER YES TO ANY OF THESE, THIS GAME MAY NOT BE WORKING AS WELL FOR YOU
AS IT COULD. YOU MAY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TONE OF GAME YOU WANT TO
PLAY IN, AND CHANGE THE END OF SESSION MOVE TO BETTER FIT THAT.

### PLAYBOOK MOVES

VARIOUS PLAYBOOK MOVES INVOLVE MARKING EXPERIENCE, OR ALLOWING OTHERS TO
MARK EXPERIENCE. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO NOTE THESE TO THE TABLE, SO THEY
CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR MOTIVATIONS ARE, AND KNOW WHAT YOU ARE OFFERING
THEM.

CHOOSING ADVANCEMENTS
---------------------

WHEN YOU REACH 5 EXPERIENCE, ERASE ALL BUBBLES AND CHOOSE AN ADVANCEMENT
FROM A TIER THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO. EACH PLAYBOOK HAS THEIR OWN SET OF
ADVANCEMENTS, YOU MUST CHOOSE AN ADVANCEMENT FROM THE PLAYBOOK YOU ARE
PLAYING. ADVANCEMENTS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, CAN ONLY BE CHOSEN ONCE.
FILL IN THE BUBBLE ON YOUR PLAYBOOK TO NOTE THAT THE ADVANCEMENT HAS
BEEN TAKEN. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SOME ADVANCEMENTS HAVE A \* NEXT TO
THEM, WHICH REPRESENTS THAT IT CAN BE TAKEN ANY NUMBER OF TIMES. YOU
DON'T NEED TO TRY AND FILL THAT IN. ADVANCEMENTS ARE BOTH PRESCRIPTIVE
AND DESCRIPTIVE, LIKE MOST THINGS IN THIS GAME. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO TAKE
AN ADVANCEMENT TO MOVE YOUR CHARACTER IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION, OR TO
ACKNOWLEDGE MECHANICALLY A DIRECTION THEY ARE ALREADY MOVING IN. IN
EITHER CASE, TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THE FICTION, WHAT
MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR YOUR CHARACTER, AND WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST FUN.
ATTEMPTING TO MIN-MAX YOUR CHARACTER ADVANCEMENTS CAN BE DISAPPOINTING
IN THIS GAME.

### TIER 1 ADVANCEMENTS

TIER 1 ADVANCEMENTS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CHARACTERS WITHOUT
RESTRICTION, THESE ARE YOUR PLAYBOOK'S BASE LEVEL ADVANCEMENTS. SOME OF
THE ADVANCEMENTS LISTED BELOW ARE UNTETHERED ADVANCEMENTS IN CERTAIN
PLAYBOOKS, AND CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED WHEN THE CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING
UNTETHERED ADVANCEMENTS ARE MET.

#### GAIN +1 IN A STAT

THIS ADVANCEMENT ADDS +1 TO ONE OF YOUR STATS, UP TO A MAXIMUM LISTED ON
YOUR PLAYBOOK. IF YOUR STAT IS ALREADY AT THIS MAXIMUM, TAKING THE
IMPROVEMENT WILL CONFER NO BENEFIT ON YOUR CHARACTER.

#### PICK A NEW OPTION FOR A PLAYBOOK SPECIFIC ACCOUTREMENT

THIS ADVANCEMENT WILL SPECIFY A NEW OPTION FOR ONE OF YOUR PLAYBOOK
SPECIFIC ACCOUTREMENTS. THIS MIGHT IMPROVE YOUR PLACE OF POWER, OR A
GROUP OF NPCS THAT YOUR CHARACTER HAS INFLUENCE OVER. YOU CAN CHOOSE A
NEGATIVE MODIFIER UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED.

#### GAIN A NEW MOVE FROM YOUR PLAYBOOK

THIS ADVANCEMENT LETS YOU PICK ANOTHER MOVE FROM YOUR CURRENT PLAYBOOK,
ONE OF THE ONES YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO. FILL OUT ANY RELEVANT
PARTS OF YOUR PLAYBOOK, MAKE ANY RELEVANT CHOICES AT THIS TIME. THINK
ABOUT HOW YOUR CHARACTER MIGHT HAVE GAINED MASTERY OF THIS ABILITY,
GAINING THE MOVE GIVES THEM RELIABLE RESULTS WHEN THEY TRY TO DO IT, AS
OPPOSED TO THE WIDE-OPEN WORLD OF TRYING TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WITHOUT
A MOVE. THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR CHARACTER TO HAVE GAINED THIS
MOVE. IS IT SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING (ON OR OFF SCREEN)? IS IT
SOMETHING THEY TRIED ONCE AND QUICKLY FOUND A KNACK FOR? IS IT SOMETHING
THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THEY CAN DO, AND THE FIRST TIME THE MOVE
TRIGGERS WILL BE A SURPRISE TO THEM?

#### GAIN A MOVE FROM ANOTHER PLAYBOOK

THIS ADVANCEMENT LETS YOU PICK A NEW MOVE FROM A DIFFERENT PLAYBOOK THAN
YOUR OWN. THIS IS AS CLOSE TO "MULTI-CLASSING" AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET
IN CONSENSUS. TRY TO PICK A MOVE FROM A PLAYBOOK THAT ISN'T ALREADY IN
PLAY, OR IF YOU DO HAVE YOUR EYE ON A MOVE THAT IS IN A PLAYBOOK SOME
OTHER PLAYER IS PLAYING FOR ONE OF THEIR CHARACTERS, TALK TO THEM FIRST.
PLAYBOOK MOVES ARE ONE OF THE BIG WAYS THAT CHARACTERS IN CONSENSUS ARE
UNIQUE, SO TRY NOT TO PICK A MOVE THAT ANOTHER CHARACTER ALREADY HAS.

REMOVE A RESTRICTION FROM YOUR PARADIGM
---------------------------------------

RESTRICTIONS MAY BE ADDED TO YOUR CHARACTER'S PARADIGM BY THE MC DURING
PLAY. THESE ARE LIMITATIONS ON WHAT YOU CAN DO WITHIN YOUR LIMITATIONS,
SIMILAR TO THE OPPOSED CHOICES YOU MADE AT CHARACTER CREATION. CHOOSING
THIS ADVANCEMENT IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THEM. THIS ADVANCEMENT, LIKE
MOST ADVANCEMENTS, CAN ONLY BE CHOSEN ONCE, SO CHOOSE CAREFULLY WHEN YOU
DECIDE TO USE IT. THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR CHARACTER OVERCOMES THIS
RESTRICTION. IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE BIG AND MOMENTUS FOR THEM, BUT IT
VERY WELL MIGHT BE.

#### (SPECIAL) GIVE A FREEDOM TO ANOTHER MAGE'S PARADIGM

THIS SPECIAL ADVANCEMENT, NOTED BY AN ASTERISK ON YOUR PLAYBOOK, CAN BE
TAKEN ANY NUMBER OF TIMES. YOU CHOOSE A FREEDOM TO GIVE TO ANOTHER
MAGE'S PARADIGM, BASICALLY A LOOPHOLE OR EXEMPTION TO ONE OF THEIR
OPPOSED ASPECTS. THEY WRITE THIS FREEDOM ON THEIR CHARACTER SHEET, ALONG
WITH WHO GAVE IT TO THEM. FREEDOMS ONLY WORK WHILE THE RECEIVING
CHARACTER IS WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE CHARACTER WHO GAVE IT TO THEM.
THESE REPRESENT REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEAMWORK, CHARACTER GROWTH, AND
SYNERGY. AS CHARACTERS WORK MORE TOGETHER, CONSIDER GIVING FREEDOMS TO
MAKE NOTE OF HOW THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER. ESPECIALLY PAY
ATTENTION IF MOVES LIKE WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT, ASSERT YOUR PARADIGM, IF
YOU ASK ME, CLARITY OF PURPOSE, OR STRONG AVATAR HAVE BEEN RECENTLY
TRIGGERED.

#### (SPECIAL) GAIN AN ANCHOR

THIS SPECIAL ADVANCEMENT, NOTED BY AN ASTERISK ON YOUR PLAYBOOK, CAN BE
TAKEN ANY NUMBER OF TIMES. YOU MAY GAIN A NEW ANCHOR, IN A CATEGORY THAT
YOU DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE ONE IN. YOU CAN NEVER GET BACK TO YOUR STARTING
NUMBER OF ANCHORS WITH THIS ADVANCEMENT HOWEVER. THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR
CHARACTER HAS GAINED THIS ANCHOR, SOMETIMES IT WILL BE OBVIOUS FROM
PLAY, SUCH AS BUYING A HOUSE OR GAINING A NEW IMPORTANT (MUNDANE)
FRIEND. SOMETIMES IT WILL BE LESS OBVIOUS, AND YOU WILL NEED TO COME UP
WITH A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANCHOR AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO
IT FOR THE MC.

### TIER 2 ADVANCEMENTS

TIER 2 ADVANCEMENTS ARE UNLOCKED ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE TAKEN FIVE TIER 1
ADVANCEMENTS. THESE REPRESENT LARGE CHANGES TO THE CHARACTER, AND DO NOT
MAKE SENSE FOR A BRAND NEW CHARACTER TO TAKE.

#### RETIRE TO SAFETY

IF YOU CHOOSE THIS, YOUR CHARACTER STOPS BEING PLAYABLE. THEY HAVE
DECIDED TO OPT FOR A SIMPLER, SAFER LIFE, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.
DESCRIBE WHERE THEY SETTLE, OR HOW THEY HEAD OFF INTO THE SUNSET.
PERHAPS THEY FINALLY DO BUILD THAT WIZARD'S TOWER IN A NEARBY PLANE, OR
MAYBE THEY'RE STILL YOUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR, BUT WHO'S NO LONGER GOING
OUT LOOKING FOR WHERE THINGS ARE WRONG AND FIXING THEM. DOING THIS BINDS
THE MC TO NOT KILL YOUR CHARACTER, TOSS THEM INTO A DISCORDANT REALM, OR
OTHERWISE GREATLY MESS WITH THEM. THEY MIGHT SHOW UP, AS A NON-PLAYER
CHARACTER, ON OCCASION, SINCE THEY STILL EXIST IN THE WORLD, BUT THEY
SHOULDN'T BE GOING AROUND, HAVING ADVENTURES ANYMORE, AND TROUBLE WON'T
SEEK THEM OUT AS IT WILL ACTIVELY PLAYED MAGES.

IF YOU ARE STILL PLAYING IN THE CAMPAIGN WHEN YOU CHOOSE THIS, AND DON'T
HAVE ANY OTHER CHARACTERS, MAKE A NEW CHARACTER TO JOIN IN.

#### SWITCH PLAYBOOKS

THIS REPRESENTS A MORE PROFOUND CHANGE TO THE WAY YOUR CHARACTER
APPROACHES THE WORLD THAN SIMPLY GAINING A NEW MOVE. MAYBE YOUR WAYFARER
HAS FOUND A REASON TO STOP WANDERING, IN A GROUP OF MAGES THEY NOW CALL
FAMILY, AND SO CHANGES TO A CABALIST. MAYBE THE HEDGE MAGE HAS A BRUSH
WITH DEATH THAT CHANGES THEIR OUTLOOK ON LIFE AND THEY BECOME A PIOUS.
MAYBE THE PRIMORDIAL GETS CONVINCED THAT THE OLD WAYS ARE DYING AND THEY
JOIN THE WINNING SIDE AS A TECH ADEPT.

IN ANY CASE, THE CHARACTER'S CORE SELF DOESN'T CHANGE, SO BY DEFAULT
THEY KEEP THEIR NAME, LOOKS, ANCHORS, STATS, AND ANY MOVES THAT SEEM
PARTICULARLY ICONIC. THAT BEING SAID, THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO SHAKE
ANYTHING UP IF IT SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE. PERHAPS THE CHARACTER
SWITCHES ONE OF THEIR ANCHORS, AND EXPLAINS HOW THAT HAPPENS IN THE
WORLD, OR CHANGES THE GENERAL LOOK OF THEIR EYES OR AURA.

IF YOU TAKE THIS ADVANCEMENT, YOU'LL NEGOTIATE WITH THE TABLE ABOUT WHAT
ASPECTS OF THE OLD PLAYBOOK TRANSFER OVER TO THE NEW ONE. GENERALLY WE
ADVISE THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP ONE MOVE FROM YOUR OLD PLAYBOOK
THAT WAS PARTICULARLY ICONIC TO THE WAY YOU PLAYED THEM. WE ADVISE THAT
YOU PICK A PARADIGM FROM THE NEW PLAYBOOK, BUT PERHAPS KEEP ELEMENTS OF
YOUR OLD PARADIGM IF THEY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO STICK AROUND AFTER SUCH
A BIG CHANGE. FOR GEAR, THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS EITHER KEEP YOUR OLD
PLAYBOOK GEAR, OR TAKE THE GEAR FROM THE NEW PLAYBOOK, BUT THE TABLE CAN
TALK ABOUT IT IF SOME THINGS MAKE SENSE TO TRANSFER OVER, AND YOU ALSO
WANT SOME OF THE GEAR THE NEW PLAYBOOK OFFERS.

#### START A SECOND CHARACTER

YOU CAN ALSO START AN ENTIRELY NEW CHARACTER, TO PLAY ALONGSIDE YOUR OLD
ONE. THEY ARE WHOLLY INDEPENDENT BEINGS, WHO JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE THE
SAME PLAYER, LIKE HOW ALL NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS ARE PLAYED BY THE SAME
MC. DO THIS THE SAME WAY A NEW CHARACTER WOULD BE ADDED TO THE CAMPAIGN.
SELECT A PLAYBOOK THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN PLAY, MAKE ALL OF THE CHOICES
THAT YOU WOULD AT THE START OF A CAMPAIGN, AT THE TABLE WHERE YOU CAN
GET INPUT FROM OTHERS. WRITE A FLAG, AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY FIT INTO
THE WORLD THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED.

IF YOU HAVE TWO, OR EVEN THREE CHARACTERS, IT CAN BE HARD TO FIT
EVERYBODY IN. SO, WHEN YOU ARE TOLD TO DO SOMETHING FOR ALL CHARACTERS
AT THE START OF THE SESSION, SELECT AT LEAST ONE, WHO YOU WANT TO SEE IN
PLAY. IF YOU'RE SURE YOU WILL WANT TO SEE MULTIPLE, THAT'S FINE. LATER,
IF ANOTHER OF YOUR CHARACTERS IS GOING TO BE IN A SCENE, COVER THEIR
START OF SESSION ACTIONS RIGHT THEN: UPDATING THEIR FLAG, MARK A CODE OF
EACH OF THEIR ANCHORS' STATUS TRACKS AND DETERMINE WHAT THEY MEAN, TAKE
STOCK OF THEIR SLIPPING STATUS TRACKS, AND ROLL START OF SESSION MOVES.
AT THE END OF THE SESSION, ONLY CHARACTERS YOU PLAYED MARK EXPERIENCE IN
RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS.

NOTE THAT NOT PLAYING A CHARACTER DOESN'T STOP, FOR EXAMPLE, FORESHADOWS
RELATED TO THEM FROM ADVANCING, SO DO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THEIR
MOMENTS IN THE SPOTLIGHT AS APPROPRIATE.

### UNTETHERED ADVANCEMENTS

SOME VERY POWERFUL ADVANCEMENTS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO MAGES WHO HAVE
LEFT BEHIND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ATTACHMENT TO THE MUNDANE WORLD, OR ARE
SUFFICIENTLY INSPIRED IN THE MAGICAL WORLD. UNTETHERED ADVANCEMENTS MAY
ONLY BE ACCESSED BY CHARACTERS THAT HAVE UNLOCKED TIER 2 ADVANCEMENTS,
AND ONLY IF THEY ARE UNTETHERED AT THE TIME OF REACHING THEIR FIFTH
EXPERIENCE. IF A CHARACTER BECOMES TETHERED AGAIN, THEY RETAIN ANY
ADVANCEMENTS GAINED WHILE UNTETHERED. ADVANCED MOVES FOR EACH PLAYBOOK
ARE UNDER THIS TIER, AND ARE SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL MOVES AVAILABLE.

#### BECOMING UNTETHERED: INSPIRATIONS AND ANCHORS

A CHARACTER BECOMES UNTETHERED WHEN THEY HAVE MORE INSPIRATIONS THAN
THEY DO ANCHORS. THIS CAN HAPPEN BY GAINING A NEW INSPIRATION OR BY
LOSING AN ANCHOR. (SOMETIMES BOTH MAY HAPPEN AT ONCE, BUT THIS IS LIKELY
A RARE OCCURRENCE.) THEY REMAIN UNTETHERED WHILE THIS REMAINS TRUE.
HOWEVER, IF A CHARACTER AT ANY POINT HAS AT LEAST TWICE AS MANY
INSPIRATIONS AS THEY DO ANCHORS, THAT CHARACTER BECOMES LOST AND IS NO
LONGER A PLAYABLE CHARACTER (SEE [LOSING A
CHARACTER](AnchorsandInspirationsLosingACharacter)). THIS IS THE CAREFUL
BALANCING ACT MAGES MUST DO IN ORDER TO ACCESS THEIR MOST POWERFUL
ADVANCEMENTS.

#### (SPECIAL) REMOVE A RESTRICTION FROM YOUR PARADIGM

THIS IS THE SAME ADVANCEMENT AS THE ONE-TIME ADVANCEMENT FROM TIER 1,
BUT AS IT IS NOTATED WITH AN ASTERISK, CAN BE TAKEN ANY NUMBER OF TIMES
WHILE UNTETHERED.

{{ANCHORADVANCED MOVES}}

### ADVANCED MOVES

ADVANCED MOVES FOR EACH OF THE PLAYBOOKS CAN BE FOUND BELOW. THESE MOVES
OFTEN CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE GAME OR THE WORLD SIGNIFICANTLY, AND WITH
ONE EXCEPTION, EACH PLAYBOOK CAN ONLY TAKE ONE ADVANCED MOVE. THIS IS
LIKELY THE CULMINATION OF YOUR CHARACTER'S GOALS, ABILITIES, OR
RESEARCH, SO CONSIDER VERY CAREFULLY WHAT MOVE FITS THEM BEST.

#### CONSENSUS SHIFTING

IF YOU HAVE AN ADVANCED MOVE THAT LETS YOU ATTEMPT TO SHIFT THE
CONSENSUS, YOU START A CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK. IF THIS STATUS
TRACK REACHES CODE N, YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SHIFTED THE CONSENSUS. THIS
TRACK IS RACING AGAINST THE CONSENSUS FRONT STATUS TRACK THOUGH, AS YOU
ARE LIKELY NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS TRYING TO SWAY THE SUBCONSCIOUS OF
THE UNIVERSE. IF THE CONSENSUS FRONT STATUS TRACK REACHES CODE N, THE GM
WILL CHOOSE TO EITHER SHIFT THE CONSENSUS IN FAVOR OF ONE OF THE FRONTS,
IN WHICH CASE YOU WILL RESET YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFT TRACK TO CODE 50, OR
THEY WILL CHOOSE TO SHIFT THE CONSENSUS TO BLOCK YOUR SHIFT. (THIS
REPRESENTS A FACTION REFUTING THE POSSIBILITY OF YOUR SHIFT BEFORE YOU
ESTABLISH IT IN THE CONSENSUS.) IF THE GM SHIFTS THE CONSENSUS TO BLOCK
YOUR SHIFT, OR IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY REACH CODE N, YOU MAY START A NEW
CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK NEXT TIME YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFTING MOVE
TRIGGERS.

#### CABALIST ADVANCED MOVES

##### STRENGTH OF THE CIRCLE

ONCE PER SESSION, WHEN YOU WOULD GAIN ANY AMOUNT OF DISCORD, YOUR CABAL
INTERCEPTS THE DISCORD AND SPREADS IT AMONG THE MEMBERS, EFFECTIVELY
DILUTING IT ENOUGH TO DISSIPATE IT.

##### CULT

YOUR CABAL FOLLOWS YOU FANATICALLY. ADD THE FOLLOWING OPTION TO GOSSAMER
THREADS, AND ALWAYS CHOOSE +1 OPTION WHEN YOU ROLL THAT MOVE, EVEN ON A
MISS.

-   THEY GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY.

##### GROUP RESEARCH

WHEN YOUR CABAL HELPS YOU RESEARCH, ON A 12+, HOLD 2. USE THIS HOLD 1
FOR 1 TO INTRODUCE A PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN FACT OR WEAKNESS ABOUT THE TOPIC
OF YOUR RESEARCH AT ANY TIME.

#### GURU ADVANCED MOVES

##### NEKKHAMMA

ONCE PER SESSION, WHEN YOU LOSE AN ANCHOR, TREAT THE ROLL AS A 10+, NO
MATTER WHAT IT IS. MARK AN ADDITIONAL XP. WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR LAST
ANCHOR, YOU IMMEDIATELY GAIN ONE FINAL ANCHOR OF \"MY LOVE FOR
HUMANITY", CONTINUE PLAYING AS NORMAL.

##### DIAMOND BODY

ANY TIME YOU TAKE HARM, REDUCE IT BY 1 (TO A MINIMUM OF 0)

##### MASS AWAKENING

ALL OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE AWAKENED, CHANGE PLAYBOOKS TO CABALISTS.

#### HEDGE MAGE ADVANCED MOVES

##### FAMILIAR

YOU MAY TAKE A MAGICAL BEING OR OBJECT AS AN ANCHOR. YOU MAY ONLY EVER
HAVE ONE MAGICAL ANCHOR AT A TIME. YOUR MAGICAL ANCHOR MAY ALSO BE AN
INSPIRATION.

##### UNIVERSAL UNDERSTANDING

REMOVE AN OPPOSED ASPECT FROM YOUR PARADIGM

##### TRUE SUMMONING

CALL THROUGH SHADOW CAN NOW WORK ON MAGICAL OBJECTS AND BEINGS, AS WELL
AS SPECIFIC OBJECTS AND BEINGS.

##### PUSH THE CONSENSUS

WHEN YOU TAKE THIS MOVE, YOU MAY NOTE A SMALL BUT ARCANE SHIFT YOU ARE
ATTEMPTING TO MAKE IN THE CONSENSUS. START A CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS
TRACK. WHEN YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED HARMONIOUS MAGIC THAT
STRETCHES THE LIMITS OF COINCIDENCE (IN A WAY RELATED TO YOUR CONSENSUS
SHIFT) IN FRONT OF A WOULD-BE LOOKOUT, ROLL +ANCHORS. ON A HIT, ADVANCE
THE CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK. ON A 7-9, CHOOSE 1:

-   OOPS, THAT WAS ACTUALLY RENDING MAGIC!

-   OOPS, YOU SLIPPED IT BY THE CONSENSUS TOO WELL, DON'T ADVANCE THE
    CONSENSUS SHIFT TRACK.

-   OOPS, THE CONSENSUS NOTICED, BUT SO DID... SOMETHING ELSE. THE GM
    WILL ADVANCE THE CONSENSUS FRONT AND UP TO ONE OTHER RELATED FRONT.

ON A 6-, THAT WAS CERTAINLY RENDING MAGIC! THE GM MAKES A HARD MOVE

#### INSPIRED ADVANCED MOVES

##### WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS

WHEN YOU ROLL A 10+ ON THE BACKLASH MOVE, BRING SOMEONE WITH YOU. THEY
SEE AND EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU DO, BUT RETAIN THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND
AWARENESS OF REALITY

##### MIND WIDE OPEN

ADD THIS TO OPEN THEIR MIND: ON A 12+, THEY AWAKEN.

##### HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION, ROLL +WITHIN. ON A 10+ HOLD 3, ON A 7-9
HOLD 2, ON A MISS HOLD 1. SPEND A HOLD TO NEGATE ONE OF THE NEGATIVE
TAGS OF YOUR SOURCE FOR A SCENE. (THIS COULD SIMPLY MEAN THE NEGATIVE
TAGS AREN'T INTERFERING FOR WHATEVER REASON, OR IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF
SOMETHING YOU DID, MAGICAL OR MUNDANE. NARRATE AS APPROPRIATE.)

##### TERROR AND WONDER

WHEN YOU TAKE THIS MOVE, YOU MAY NOTE ONE MODERATE SHIFT (ON PAR WITH A
MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH), OR TWO TINY SHIFTS YOU ARE ATTEMPTING
TO MAKE IN THE CONSENSUS. START A CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK (ONLY
ONE, EVEN IF YOU CHOSE TWO TINY SHIFTS) WHEN YOU **DO RENDING MAGIC
(THAT DIRECTLY RELATES TO YOUR INTENDED CONSENSUS SHIFT) IN FRONT OF A
LARGE GROUP OF WITNESSES**, TAKE 3 DISCORD AND ROLL +DYNAMIC AND ADVANCE
YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK. ON A 10+, ADVANCE YOUR CONSENSUS
SHIFT STATUS TRACK AGAIN. ON A 7-9, CHOOSE 1:

-   YOU ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY SUCKED INTO A REALITY BUBBLE

-   THE GM DOES NOT ADVANCE THE CONSENSUS FRONT

-   ADVANCE YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK AGAIN

ON A 6-, YOU ARE SUCKED INTO A REALITY BUBBLE, AND YOUR GRIP ON REALITY
STATUS TRACK STARTS HAVING HIT CODE 30.

#### PIOUS

##### AWAKENER

WHEN YOU PERFORM RENDING MAGIC IN FRONT OF A NON-MAGICAL WITNESS, YOU
MAY ADD ANOTHER OPTION TO THE LIST: THEY AWAKEN. YOU MAY ONLY CHOOSE
THIS OPTION IF YOU DON'T CHOSE "YOU DON'T CAUSE COLLATERAL DAMAGE."

##### HUMANIST

WHEN YOU SHOW SOMEONE THE VALUE OF HUMANITY, THEY MAY IMMEDIATELY GAIN
AN ANCHOR. THEY MAY GO ABOVE THEIR STARTING NUMBER OF ANCHORS FOR THIS.

##### SECRET KEEPER

WHEN YOU AND ANOTHER CHARACTER **EXCHANGE A MOMENT OF HUMANITY** IN
ADDITION TO ANY OTHER EFFECTS, YOU IMMEDIATELY LEARN ONE SECRET ABOUT
THAT CHARACTER. ASK THEIR PLAYER FOR A DEEP SECRET ABOUT THE CHARACTER.
WHEN YOU DO, CHOOSE ONE FROM EACH LINE: \* THE SECRET GETS OUT, THE
SECRET IS MAGICALLY SEALED, THE SECRET IS FORGOTTEN BY EVERYONE BUT ME
\* HOLD 3 AS PER ASSERT YOUR PARADIGM, HOLD 3 AS PER VOWS, HOLD 3 SPENT
1 FOR 1 TO HAVE THEM SUFFER 0 HARM \* TRANSFER ALL OF THEIR DISCORD TO
YOU, TRANSFER ALL OF THEIR HARM TO YOU, NOTHING

#### PRIMORDIAL ADVANCED MOVES

##### ONE WITH EVERYTHING

REMOVE AN OPPOSED ASPECT FROM YOUR PARADIGM

##### IRON WILL

ONCE PER SESSION WHEN YOU PUT WILLPOWER BEHIND CHANGING IT, YOU MAY
CHOOSE NONE OF THE OPTIONS.

##### FOUNTAIN OF POWER

WHEN YOU ARE AT A PLACE OF POWER, YOU MAY DO MAGIC WITHIN YOUR PARADIGM
BUT BEYOND YOUR NORMAL ABILITIES (WITHOUT EXPENDING A MAGICAL RESOURCE).
IN ADDITION, YOU ARE AWARE OF THE MAGIC STORES WITHIN THE PLACE OF
POWER.

#### TECH ADEPT ADVANCED MOVES

##### PUBLISH OR PERISH

WHEN YOU TAKE THIS MOVE, YOU MAY NOTE A SMALL BUT SUBSTANTIAL SHIFT YOU
ARE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE IN THE CONSENSUS. START A CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS
TRACK. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION, ROLL +WITHOUT. ON A 10+, ADVANCE
YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFT TRACK. ON A 7-9, ADVANCE YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFT
TRACK, BUT CHOOSE 1:

-   THE GM ADVANCES THE CONSENSUS FRONT

-   ADD A NEGATIVE "QUIRK" TO YOUR CONSENSUS SHIFT. (EX. THE PANACEA YOU
    ARE WORKING INTO THE CONSENSUS SOMETIMES JUST UP AND KILLS THE
    PERSON DOSED WITH IT, INSTEAD OF CURING THEM.)

ON A MISS, THE GM WILL ADVANCE THE CONSENSUS FRONT AND MAKE A MOVE.

##### REALITY 2.0

REMOVE AN OPPOSED ASPECT FROM YOUR PARADIGM

##### PERFECTED BLUEPRINTS

ADD THE FOLLOWING TO UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMER: ON A 12+ YOU CAN MAKE
ADDITIONAL COPIES OF IT WITHOUT ROLLING, AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE TIME
AND MATERIALS.

##### DETAILED ANALYSIS

WHEN YOU ROLL THINGS SPEAK, ALWAYS ASK 1 ADDITIONAL QUESTION. IN
ADDITION, ADD THESE QUESTIONS TO THE LIST OF POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:

-   WHAT IS THE HIDDEN POWER OF THIS OBJECT?

-   WHAT IS THIS OBJECT'S GREATEST USE IN THE CURRENT SITUATION?

-   WHY WAS THIS OBJECT MEANT FOR ME?

#### VOICED ADVANCED MOVES

##### RENOWN

YOU ARE POWERFUL, CONNECTED, OR OTHERWISE A BIG DEAL. YOU YOURSELF COUNT
AS A SIGNIFICANT OR POWERFUL GROUP FOR THE PURPOSES OF POWER VESTED IN
ME.

##### STORYTELLER

WHEN YOU TELL A GROUP OF NON-MAGICAL PEOPLE A COMPELLING STORY ABOUT A
SEEMINGLY MAGICAL FEAT THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS PERFORMED, START A
CONSENSUS SHIFT STATUS TRACK ABOUT THAT MAGICAL FEAT. IF A STATUS TRACK
ALREADY EXISTS FOR THAT CONSENSUS SHIFT, ROLL +WITHOUT AND THE MC
ADVANCES THE CONSENSUS FRONT. ON A HIT, THEY ARE INTERESTED AND WANT TO
HEAR MORE. ON A 10+, THEY ALSO DON'T DOUBT OR CONTRADICT YOU, AND WORD
DOESN'T GET BACK TO AN INTERESTED PARTY, THE GM DOES NOT ADVANCE THE
CONSENSUS FRONT. ON A 12+, ADDITIONALLY, ADVANCE THE RELEVANT CONSENSUS
SHIFT STATUS TRACK.

##### HEART OF THE STORM

CHOOSE ONE LARGE-REACHING EFFECT THAT YOU SPECIALIZE IN. (EXAMPLES
INCLUDE: CONJURING STORMS, CREATING GOLEMS, MIRACULOUS HEALING). FOR
THIS EFFECT, ONLY ROLL THE DO RENDING MAGIC MOVE IF YOU ARE DIRECTLY
WITNESSED CASTING THIS BY A WITNESS, RATHER THAN IF IT AFFECTS A
WITNESS.

#### WAYFARER ADVANCED MOVES

##### DEMIPLANE

YOU GAIN A PLACE OF POWER THAT ISN'T ENTIRELY OF THIS WORLD. IT IS
AFFORDED MORE PROTECTION AND POWER THAN A STANDARD PLACE OF POWER.

FIRST PICK CURRENT FACADE:

-   DESERTED ISLAND

-   MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

-   SMALL DIMLY LIT SHOP

-   A PLAIN WHITE INFINITE EXPANSE

PICK UP TO 1-2 STRENGTHS:

-   AWAKENED SPIRIT

-   WARDED

-   INSTANTLY ACCESSIBLE

-   BOUNTIFUL

PICK AT LEAST ONE DANGER:

-   LABYRINTHINE

-   MESMERIZING

-   TRANSFORMATIVE

-   DRAINING

A RITUAL HERE WILL NEVER:

-   TAKE EXTRA TIME

-   REQUIRE HELP FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE

IT WILL ALSO NEVER:

-   DRAW UNWANTED ATTENTION

-   CAUSE BACKLASH

-   CAUSE DISCORD

##### FIND THE PATH

WHEN YOU SEEK THE PATH TO A PLACE THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE, THE MC WILL TELL
YOU HOW TO GET THERE.

##### EXILE

ADD THIS OPTION TO ASSERT YOUR PARADIGM AND IMPRESS A LUSUS NATURAE: ON
A 12+, YOU MAY INSTEAD CHOOSE TO EXILE YOUR TARGET FROM ONE OF: - THEIR
HOME - THIS LAND - THIS WORLD. NAME A CONDITION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO
RETURN. THIS CANNOT TARGET ANOTHER PLAYER'S CHARACTER WITHOUT THE
PLAYER'S CONSENT.

CUSTOM MOVES
------------

SOMETIMES, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR THAT SOMETHING YOUR CHARACTER DOES IS
ICONIC OR FREQUENT ENOUGH THAT IT'S WORTH CODIFYING. THE TABLE CAN
FIGURE OUT A MOVE, STRUCTURED JUST LIKE A PLAYBOOK MOVE, THAT REFLECTS
THIS ACTION AND THE STANDARD OUTCOMES. THIS USUALLY SHOULDN'T DEFINE
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS, SO MUCH AS SIMPLIFY
EXECUTING IT. NOW IT'S NOT "I'M GOING TO CAST THAT SUMMONING SPELL I
WORKED OUT," THEN LOOKING TO THE MC TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, AND THEY MAKE A
SOFT MOVE REFLECTING THE OUTCOME, BUT RATHER, YOU CAST THE SUMMONING
SPELL, TRIGGERING THE MOVE "WHEN YOU CAST YOUR RESEARCHED SUMMONING
SPELL," AND FOLLOW FROM THERE. MOST OF THE TIME, WHEN YOU WRITE ONE OF
THESE, IT SHOULD CONSUME AN ADVANCEMENT, COMING AFTER YOU HAVE MARKED
FIVE EXPERIENCE.

SEE THE HACKING SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS ON CREATING MOVES, BUT IN
GENERAL, A MOVE HAS A TRIGGER, DESCRIBING AN IN-GAME ACTION, AND AN
OUTCOME. THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE A SIMPLE STATEMENT, A MECHANIC SUCH AS
PROVIDING HOLD, OR AN INSTRUCTION TO MAKE A ROLL AND READ FURTHER FOR
SUCCESS AND FAILURE. CODIFYING 7-9 AND 6- RESULTS HAS A PARTICULAR KIND
OF POWER, BY MAKING THEM INTO KNOWN QUANTITIES.

DON'T USE THIS TO COPY OTHER PLAYBOOKS' MOVES, ESPECIALLY MOVES THAT ARE
ALREADY POSSESSED BY OTHER CHARACTERS AT THE TABLE.

FICTIONAL POSITIONING
---------------------

FINALLY, CHARACTERS ADVANCE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE STORY. A CHARACTER
GETS SOME MONEY AND BUYS A NEW CAR, AND NOW HAS A RELIABLE MEANS OF
GETTING AROUND. A CHARACTER MEETS A LONG-LOST COUSIN AND NOW HAS A NEW
CONNECTION TO THEIR FAMILY. A CHARACTER FINALLY BUILDS THE LIBRARY
THEY'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO. OFTEN, DUE TO THE DESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF THE
RULES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIT THESE THINGS INTO THE MECHANICS. NEW
ACQUAINTANCES CAN BECOME ANCHORS OR INSPIRATIONS, A LIBRARY MIGHT BE A
PLACE OF POWER, BUT JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T
MATTER. THERE ARE ALSO CHANGES THAT AREN'T PRECISELY MECHANICS BUT
INTERACT WITH THEM: IF YOU QUESTED OUT AND GAINED A VIAL OF SACRED WATER
FROM THE LAKE INHABITED BY THE LAST MERMAID, PERHAPS YOU NOW HAVE A
RESOURCE THAT COULD BE CONSUMED TO DO MAGIC WITHIN YOUR PARADIGM BUT
BEYOND YOUR ABILITIES.

FORCES
======

FORCES ARE ONE OF THE MAIN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES USED IN MCING
CONSENSUS. THEY GIVE YOU A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT POWERS ARE IN THE
WORLD, AND HOW FAR ALONG THEY ARE IN THEIR GOALS. YOU MAKE FORCES
BETWEEN SESSIONS, COLLATING WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE STORY AND WHERE YOU
IMAGINE IT MAY GO.

A FORCE CAN BE MANY THINGS: IT MIGHT BE AN AMBITIOUS ORGANIZATION, SOME
LUSUS NATURAE FROM ELSEWHERE, OR EVEN A COLLECTION OF CURSED ITEMS, EACH
WITH THEIR OWN MOTIVATION. THE POINT IS TO GATHER THEM TOGETHER FOR YOUR
OWN RECORDS, AND KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ACT. THAT'S WHERE THE NAME
FORCE COMES FROM: THEY ARE THINGS WHICH WILL ACT, AND MAKE CHANGES IN
THE WORLD.

NOTE THAT FORCES CAN BE ALLIES OR ENEMIES, OR NEITHER. THEY MAY HAVE
THEIR OWN AGENDAS, BUT AT TIMES, SOME MAGES MAY REALIZE THAT THEY DO NOT
WANT TO IMPEDE A FORCE, AND INDEED WISH TO HELP IT ALONG. IN ADDITION,
WHAT IS A POSITIVE FORCE TO ONE MAGE MIGHT BE A NEGATIVE FORCE TO
ANOTHER. FORCES ARE COMPLEX. NO FORCE SHOULD SIMPLY EXIST TO BE
DEFEATED.

FINALLY, FORCES SHOULD NOT HAVE PERFECTLY ALIGNED GOALS. IF THEY DO,
THEN IT IS REALLY ONCE FORCE BEING DESCRIBED. THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE
ACTIVE ENEMIES OF EACH OTHER, BUT EVEN VERY POSITIVE FORCES IN THE WORLD
CAN FIND THEMSELVES PUSHING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

PARTS OF A FORCE
----------------

FORCES ARE TRACKED ON THE FORCE SHEETS, SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY REFERENCE
THEM WHILE PLAYING. THEY SHOULD PUT THE INFORMATION YOU NEED FRONT AND
CENTER SO YOU CAN QUICKLY MAKE DECISIONS, REFERENCE ESTABLISHED FACTS,
AND RECORD IMPORTANT CHANGES.

FORCES HAVE A NAME AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION, SO THAT YOU CAN KEEP
REMINDING YOURSELF OF WHAT THEY ARE. A FORCE THAT HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN A
LITTLE WHILE MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED YOUR MIND, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A LONG
TIME BETWEEN GAMES, SO ERR ON THE SIDE OF BEING DESCRIPTIVE. "GHOST
PIRATES!" IS A LOT BETTER THAN "WHAT COMES FROM THE MISTS", EVEN IF IT'S
MORE TRITE.

### STRESSOR

EACH FORCE IS BASED ON A STRESSOR, WHICH ITSELF COMES FROM KEY ASPECTS
OF ONE OR MORE CHARACTERS. A STRESSOR IS A FEELING OR OUTLOOK WHICH IS
TAKEN TOO FAR, SUCH AS FEAR, CONTROL, OR GUILT. THE STRESSOR GIVES A
LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERARCHING THEME FOR THE FORCE, AND STRESSORS HAVE
FORCE MOVES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, WHICH YOU CHOOSE FROM WHEN CREATING
THE FORCE.

THE AVAILABLE STRESSORS ARE:

-   CONTROL

-   FEAR

-   GUILT

-   ANGER

-   DISTRUST

-   EXTREMISM

-   ISOLATION

-   ENVY

-   OBSESSION

### TYPE

EACH FORCE FALLS INTO A BROAD CATEGORY OF TYPES. EACH TYPE HAS A
SUBTYPE, WHICH GIVES AN IMPULSE, WHICH DESCRIBES ITS CODE N OUTCOME.
THIS WILL NECESSARILY BE A BROAD STATEMENT, SO WHILE IT GUIDES YOU TO
WHAT THAT FORCE'S CODE N OUTCOME WILL BE, IT WON'T TELL YOU DIRECTLY
WHAT TO WRITE ON THE SHEET, JUST GIVE YOU GUIDANCE.

THE AVAILABLE TYPES ARE:

-   TRADITION

-   OUTSIDER

-   ASPARANT

-   PLACE OF POWER

-   ARTIFACT

### FORCE MOVES

EVERY FORCE HAS UP TO THREE MOVES ASSOCIATED WITH IT, CHOSEN FROM A LIST
GIVEN BY ITS STRESSOR. THESE MOVES ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AT ALL TIMES,
AND CAN BE USED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MC MOVE. LIKE MOST MC MOVES, THEY
CAN BE HARD OR SOFT, DEPENDING ON HOW EXACTLY YOU USE THEM. SOMETIMES,
THE FORCE IS ALREADY ACTIVE IN THE SCENE, AND SO THEIR MOVE IS A NATURAL
STEP. IF A MAGE IS DEALING WITH A MYSTERIOUS STAR WHO GRANTS THEM
POWERS, AND THE FORCE REPRESENTING THE STAR HAS THE MOVE "DREDGE UP THE
PAST", THEN WHEN THEY ROLL A 6- OR LOOK TO YOU FOR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, IT
MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO REVEAL THAT AN OLD FAMILY FRIEND HAS COME LOOKING
FOR YOU WITH ILL INTENTIONS. AT OTHER TIMES, YOU MIGHT USE A FORCE MOVE
TO INTRODUCE THE FORCE TO THE SCENE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT: PICK A MOVE FROM A
FORCE NOT CURRENTLY IN PLAY, AND LET THAT DIRECT WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND
SO WHAT THE CHARACTERS NEED TO REACT TO.

### CAST

HERE IS WHERE YOU CAN LIST NPCS WHO ARE CONNECTED WITH THIS FORCE. THIS
DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN THAT THEY ARE A PART OF THE ORGANIZATION IT
REPRESENTS, OR EVEN ALLIED WITH IT, JUST THAT THEY ARE MOST ASSOCIATED.
SO FOR A FORCE THAT IS THE WINTER COURT, THE FAERIE QUEEN SURELY BELONGS
IN ITS CAST. BUT SO TOO MIGHT THE SPECIAL DETECTIVE FROM THE BIG CITY
WHO'S INVESTIGATING THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES, THE ONES THAT THE
MAGES KNOW ARE CAUSED BY THE WINTER COURT.

NOTE CHARACTERS DOWN HERE AGGRESSIVELY. IT IS VERY USEFUL TO HAVE AN
ESTABLISHED CAST TO DRAW ON, ALREADY WITH NAMES AND MAYBE A WORD OR TWO
OF DESCRIPTION, WHEN YOU NEED TO HELP MAKE A FORCE FEEL ALIVE AND
ACTIVE.

### FORCE STATUS TRACKS (COUNTDOWN)

PART OF FORCES BEING AN ACTIVE PART OF THE FICTION IS THAT IF THEY ARE
LEFT UNCHECKED, THEY WILL RESULT IN SOME MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE WORLD
AROUND THEM. IN THE SIMPLEST CASE, THE FORCE REPRESENTS A GROUP OR
INDIVIDUAL AND THE CHANGE IS SOMETHING THEY ARE ACTIVELY WORKING
TOWARDS. HOWEVER, IT CAN ALSO BE A KIND OF NATURAL OUTCOME OF EACH PART
OF THE FORCE ACTING, WITHOUT BEING CONCERTED EFFORT.

THE FORCE'S STATUS TRACK KEEPS TRACK OF THE PROGRESS. THERE IS SPACE FOR
DESCRIPTION AT CODE 40, CODE 20, AND CODE N. AT EACH SPACE, WRITE
SOMETHING CLEAR AND RECOGNIZABLE THAT OCCURS. WHEN YOU MARK OFF THE CODE
BEFORE IT, MAKE CLEAR HOW THE NEXT STEP IS APPROACHING. WHEN YOU MARK
OFF A CODE WITH A DESCRIPTION, MAKE CLEAR WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND HOW THE
MAGES KNOW ABOUT IT. LIKE OTHER STATUS TRACKS, THE FORCE'S IS BOTH
PRESCRIPTIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE. AS A RESULT, IF YOU NOTICE THAT THE EVENT
LISTED ON THE STATUS TRACK HAS OCCURRED, MARK THE CORRESPONDING CODE OR
CODES OFF. THIS MAY ADVANCE THE STATUS TRACK TO BE SLIPPING, JUST LIKE
ANY OTHER. IF A MAJOR SETBACK OCCURS, YOU MAY EVEN ERASE CODES FROM THE
FRONT TO REPRESENT THE WORK BEING UNDONE OR PLANS FOILED.

IF YOU ADVANCE A FORCE'S STATUS TRACK AS PART OF A MOVE, BE SURE TO MAKE
THE EFFECT CLEAR AND VISIBLE. THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO SNEAK UP ON THE
OTHER PLAYERS.

### CODE N OUTCOME

WHEN A FORCE REACHES CODE N, IT MEANS A MATERIAL, IRREVOCABLE CHANCE HAS
OCCURRED IN THE FICTION. THE FORCE HAS ACHIEVED THEIR CURRENT GOAL, OR
HAS OTHERWISE MANIFESTED IN A DRAMATIC AND MEANINGFUL WAY. THIS SHOULD
NOT BE WORLD-ENDING, BUT IT MIGHT BE WORLD-UPENDING.

THE CODE N OUTCOME STARTS BASED ON THE IMPULSE OF THE TYPE. THESE ARE
BROAD CATEGORIES, THAT CAN HELP GIVE A SENSE OF DIRECTION TO THE ENTIRE
FORCE.

IF CODE N IS REACHED, TAKE SOME TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE WORLD HAS
CHANGED, AND BE SURE TO FEATURE THOSE ELEMENTS IN FOLLOWING SCENES. IN
ADDITION, UPDATE THE FORCE. SOME CAST MEMBERS MAY HAVE CHANGED, SOME
MOVES MAY CHANGE, AND THE STATUS TRACK AND CODE N OUTCOME SHOULD GET A
WHOLE NEW SET. AFTER ALL, THE FORCE HAS GOTTEN ONE OF THEIR DESIRES, AND
SO WHY WOULD THEY STOP NOW? IN SOME CASES THE FORCE MIGHT HAVE COME TO
ITS NATURAL CONCLUSION WHEN CODE N IS REACHED, AND YOU FIND THERE'S
NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE WITH IT. SEE THE SECTION BELOW ON REMOVING A
FORCE.

THE THREE QUESTIONS
-------------------

DURING CHARACTER CREATION, EACH PLAYER WILL ANSWER 3 QUESTIONS ABOUT
THEIR CHARACTER, ROUGHLY CORRESPONDING TO PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.
THESE 3 QUESTIONS WILL BE THE BASIS ON WHICH YOU BUILD YOUR FRONTS, SO
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE SOME TIME WITH EACH PLAYER TO EXPLORE THESE QUESTIONS
DURING THE FIRST SESSION.

### WHY WAS YOUR HUMANITY TRIVIALIZED?

PEOPLE WHO LIVE PERFECT LIVES NEVER QUITE FIND THE NEED TO REACH OUT
BEYOND THE REALM OF EVERYDAY LIFE TO IMPROVE THEIR EXISTENCE, OR MERELY
TO SURVIVE. MAGES TYPICALLY AWAKEN DUE TO A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, BUT
ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS IS HAVING THEIR HUMANITY DENIED OR TRIVIALIZED.
THIS COULD BE IN THE FORM OF BULLYING, ISOLATION, VIOLENCE, OR MANY
OTHER THINGS. MANY MAGES HAVE A PARTICULAR MOMENT THEY CAN POINT TO THAT
MADE EVERYTHING SO CLEAR AND AWAKENED THEIR NEW PARADIGM. SELDOM ARE
THESE MOMENTS CAUSED BY PLEASANT INTERACTION. THE ANSWER TO THIS
QUESTION WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THE MAGE'S PAST CIRCUMSTANCES.

### WHY IS YOUR HUMANITY STILL IN QUESTION?

DESPITE HOW IT MAY SEEM, EXPANDING YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO INCLUDE THE
ABILITY TO ALTER REALITY AT YOUR WHIM DOESN'T SOLVE ALL OF YOUR
PROBLEMS. FROM JUGGLING THE BALANCE BETWEEN YOUR MUNDANE JOB, BILLS, AND
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE WONDER OF THE MAGICAL WORLD, TO MUCH OF THE SAME
BIGOTRY AND DISCRIMINATION THAT MUNDANE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE, THERE ARE
THINGS THAT MAGIC JUST CAN'T COMPLETELY SOLVE FOR YOU. THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THEY WON'T TRY.

### WHY ARE YOU HUNTED?

THERE'S AN OLD ADAGE THAT EVERYONE IS EITHER RUNNING TO SOMETHING OR
RUNNING FROM SOMETHING. THAT MAY NOT HOLD TRUE FOR EVERYONE, BUT THERE
ARE REASONS THAT EACH AND EVERY MAGE MIGHT BE HUNTED. FROM THE
RELATIVELY OBVIOUS AND SINISTER, THAT SOMEONE WHO CAN DO MAGIC
CHALLENGES THE EXISTING POWER STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD, TO THE MORE BENIGN
THAT YOU HAVE TALENTS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO LEARN ABOUT OR EXPLOIT,
TO THE WEIRD LIKE INTENTIONALLY NEEDLING DANGEROUS PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU
FIND IT FUN TO BE HUNTED.

STRESSORS
---------

DURING THE FIRST SESSION, AS YOU EXPLORE THE THREE QUESTIONS, YOU WILL
FIND A MAIN STRESSOR THAT MOTIVATES THE SCENE, WRITE THEM DOWN. AFTER
THE FIRST SESSION IS OVER, YOU WILL USE THESE STRESSORS TO CREATE THE
FRONTS FOR THE GAME, AND BRING THEM TO LIFE. MAKE SURE TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH PLAYERS DURING OR BEFORE THE FIRST SESSION TO MAKE
SURE THEY CAN EXPRESS ANY STRESSORS OR THEMES THEY DO NOT WANT TO
EXPLORE FOR ANY REASON. HERE ARE THE STRESSORS THAT MIGHT COME UP.

### CONTROL

IS SOMEONE TRYING TO MANIPULATE, GAIN POWER OVER, OR OTHERWISE CONTROL
SOMEONE ELSE?

### FEAR

IS SOMEONE AFRAID OF A THREAT, REAL OR IMAGINED, OR IS SOMEONE ACTING
OUT OF FEAR?

### GUILT

IS SOMEONE PRIMARILY MOTIVATED BY AN INTERNAL GUILT, EITHER FOR
SOMETHING THEY DID OR SOMETHING THEY ARE OR WERE?

### ANGER

IS SOMEONE ANGRY, EITHER THE HOT RAGE THAT THREATENS TO BOIL OVER, OR
THE COLD ANGER THAT MOTIVATES THEM TO SEEK VENGEANCE?

### DISTRUST

IS SOMEONE MISTRUSTFUL OF OTHERS, MAYBE STRANGERS OR EVEN FRIENDS? THIS
CAN BE JUSTIFIED OR IMAGINED, DISTRUST BREEDS DISTRUST.

### EXTREMISM

HAS SOMEONE TAKEN A NOMINALLY ACCEPTABLE OPINION AND GONE SO FAR WITH IT
THAT THEY ARE CAUSING HARM TO OTHERS?

### ISOLATION

IS SOMEONE OR IS A GROUP ISOLATING THEMSELVES OR BEING FORCIBLY
ISOLATED?

### ENVY

IS SOMEONE FEELING A DEEP DESIRE FOR SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAS,
LIKE AN OBJECT, RELATIONSHIP, OR KNOWLEDGE?

### OBSESSION

IS SOMEONE PREOCCUPIED OR ENGROSSED WITH A PERSON, OBJECT, ACTION OR ETC
TO THE DEGREE THAT IT IS INTRUSIVE?

TYPES
-----

SOMETIMES YOU'LL KNOW RIGHT AWAY WHAT A FORCE IS GOING TO BE, EITHER
BECAUSE OF AN ANSWER THAT A PLAYER GAVE TO YOUR LEADING QUESTION, OR
BECAUSE SOMETHING COMES ABOUT SYNCHRONOUSLY. OTHER TIMES YOU'LL ONLY
HAVE A STRESSOR TO START WITH, SO TYPES WILL HELP YOU NARROW DOWN THE
FORCE AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. HERE'S A LIST OF THE TYPES.

### ORGANIZATION

A GROUP WITH SOME AMOUNT OF POWER, TRADITION, AND GOALS.

### OUTSIDER

AN ENTITY OR GROUP OF ENTITIES THAT AREN'T PART OF THE NORMAL
MUNDANE/HUMAN WORLD, OR ARE OTHERWISE OUTSIDE OF THE NORMS OF THE
SETTING.

### ASPIRANT

A PERSON OR SMALL GROUP WITH GREAT AMBITION AND THE WILL TO SEE IT
THROUGH.

### PLACE OF POWER

A MAGICAL OR SIGNIFICANT PLACE THAT CAN PULL AT THE THREADS OF REALITY.

### ARTIFACT

A MAGICAL OR POWERFUL ITEM THAT MAY WARP REALITY AROUND IT.

AS ABOVE SO BELOW, AS WITHIN SO WITHOUT
---------------------------------------

THE THREE QUESTIONS BECOME STRESSORS. STRESSORS WILL THEN BECOME FORCES.
THE INTERNAL AND PERSONAL STRUGGLES OF THE MAGES ARE REFLECTED IN THE
WORLD AROUND THEM, AND THE THREATS, CHALLENGES, ALLIES, AND
OPPORTUNITIES THEY MIGHT FIND. AFTER THE FIRST SESSION, SIT DOWN WITH
YOUR LIST OF STRESSORS. THINK ABOUT ANY GROUPS, INDIVIDUALS OR POWERS
THAT CAME UP DURING THE FIRST SESSION, AND MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE ANY
INTERESTING ONES IN YOUR FORCES.

HOW TO MAKE A FORCE OUT OF A STRESSOR
-------------------------------------

STEP ONE:

SIT DOWN WITH YOUR LIST OF STRESSORS FROM THE FIRST SESSION. PICK ONE OF
THEM. THEN, PICK A FORCE TYPE THAT COMPLIMENTS IT.

STEP TWO:

WRITE DOWN ANYTHING YOU ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS FORCE. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU
MIGHT KNOW SOME OF ITS CAST BECAUSE THEY WERE NAMED IN THE FIRST
SESSION. YOU MIGHT KNOW THE NAME OF THE FORCE IF THAT CAME UP. THE ONLY
THINGS YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT FILL IN DURING THIS STEP ARE THE MOVES
AND THE COUNTDOWN STEPS. THESE WILL COME DURING LATER STEPS.

STEP THREE:

CHOOSE A TYPE FOR THIS FORCE, AND THEN CHOOSE ONE OF THE SUBTYPES FROM
THE LIST BELOW.

ORGANIZATION

-   DOGMATIC (IMPULSE: ENFORCE SOME TRUTH ON THE LOCAL AREA)

-   EXPANSIONIST (IMPULSE: GROW AND GAIN MEMBERS)

-   ACQUISITIVE (IMPULSE: GAIN RESOURCES OR KNOWLEDGE)

-   VIGILANT (IMPULSE: STAND TOGETHER AND DEFEND EACH OTHER)

OUTSIDER

-   WILD (IMPULSE: TO RETURN SOMETHING TO ITS NATURAL STATE)

-   TRICKY (IMPULSE: TO BEGUILE, LURE IN, AND TOY WITH VICTIMS)

-   CORRUPTING (IMPULSE: TO INVERT A BEING'S DESIRES)

-   EPHEMERAL (IMPULSE: TO BECOME MORE REAL)

-   DESTRUCTIVE (IMPULSE: TO CONSUME, RAZE, AND DAMAGE)

ASPIRANT

-   POWER (IMPULSE: TO STEAL POWER FROM THOSE WHO HAVE IT)

-   SECRETS (IMPULSE: TO LEARN A DANGEROUS SECRET)

-   TABOO (IMPULSE: TO DO SOMETHING NO ONE WOULD DO)

-   REVENGE (IMPULSE: TO EXACT REVENGE ON SOMEONE WHO HAS WRONGED THEM)

-   ENTROPY (IMPULSE: TO RETURN THINGS TO LOWER STATES OF ENERGY)

PLACE OF POWER

-   CURSED(IMPULSE: TO DRAW IN NEW VICTIMS)

-   WILD (IMPULSE: TO GROW)

-   DEDICATED (IMPULSE: TO REDUCE CONTROL)

-   CONVERGENT (IMPULSE: TO BE USED)

-   HIDDEN (IMPULSE: TO BE FOUND)

ARTIFACT

-   POWERFUL (IMPULSE: TO OVERWHELM THE USER)

-   DESTRUCTIVE (IMPULSE: TO CAUSE COLLATERAL DAMAGE)

-   KNOWLEDGABLE (IMPULSE: TO REVEAL SOMETHING BETTER LEFT HIDDEN)

-   CURSED (IMPULSE: TO SPREAD THE CURSE)

-   BROKEN (IMPULSE: TO BE REPAIRED)

STEP FOUR:

CHOOSE UP TO THREE FORCE MOVES FROM THE STRESSOR THAT THIS FORCE IS
BASED ON. THE FORCE MOVES ARE LISTED BELOW.

CONTROL:

• SEIZE SOMETHING DEAR TO THEM • BLACKMAIL THEM • INTRODUCE A NEW ENEMY
AGENT • SPRING AN ELABORATE TRAP • MANIPULATE AN ALLY • DEMONSTRATE
POWER • APPEAR MORE REASONABLE • LOOKOUT FOR (EVEN) NON-RENDING MAGIC •
ENFORCE DOMINANT PARADIGM

FEAR:

• SHOW AND ALLY TO BE UNTRUSTWORTHY • REVEAL A NEW ENEMY CELL OR SECT •
TRACK DOWN A MARK • RESIST MAGICAL EFFECTS • TORTURE SOMEONE • UNCOVER
AND EXPLOIT A WEAKNESS • AVOID CONSEQUENCES

GUILT:

• DEPRIVE THEM OF RESOURCES • COVER UP AN ATROCITY • TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A
WEAK LINK • PRESS AN ADVANTAGE • CAUSE COLLATERAL DAMAGE

ANGER:

• DESTROY SOMETHING IRREPLACABLE • PROVOKE AN OVERREACTION • DAMAGE
INFRASTRUCTURE • DRAIN ENERGY • LASH OUT CHAOTICALLY • ENACT A
COLD-BLOODED PLAN

DISTRUST:

• MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION • HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT • CIRCULATE FALSE
INFORMATION • TURN FRIEND ON FRIEND • FLAUNT THEIR SECURE POSITIONING •
INTRODUCE SELF-DOUBT

EXTREMISM:

• CONVERT AN ALLY • EMOTIONAL BARRIERS • RESPOND DISPROPORTIONALLY

ISOLATION:

• RATIONALIZE EVIL FOR THE GREATER GOOD • MISCALCULATE EMOTIONAL
RESPONSE • BE UNSHAKABLE IN THEIR CONVICTIONS • BRAINWASH AGENTS • BREAK
A SUPPLY LINE • CAUSE A BOUNDARY TO BE CROSSED

ENVY:

• ENCHANT SOMEONE • CONCEAL WEAKNESS • SIMULATE EXPERTISE • USE THEIR
TRICKS AGAINST THEM • BRING THEM TO YOUR LEVEL • SABOTAGE THEIR
STRENGTHS

OBSESSION:

• SEDUCE SOMEONE • STALK • LOCK SOMETHING OR SOMEONE AWAY

INSECURITY:

STEP FIVE:

IF YOU HAVE NOT NAMED THE FORCE, DO SO NOW. LIKEWISE FILL IN ANY CAST
THAT ARE LIKELY TO COME UP RIGHT AWAY. WRITE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
FORCE, AND HOW IT INTERACTS WITH THE WORLD (IE THE PLAYER'S CHARACTERS
AND THE OTHER FORCES)

STEP SIX:

LOOK AT THE IMPULSE FROM THE TYPE THIS FORCE IS BASED ON, AND WRITE DOWN
A CODE N OUTCOME FOR THE FORCE. THESE ARE BROAD CATEGORIES, SO NARROW IT
DOWN AND MAKE IT SPECIFIC TO THE FORCE YOU'VE BUILT. THIS REPRESENTS
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE FORCE PROGRESSES ITS GOALS OR IS LEFT UNCHECKED,
AND THE EFFECT IT WILL HAVE ON THE WORLD. SINCE THIS IS CODE N ON A
STATUS TRACK, MAKE SURE IT IS A NEWSWORTHY EVENT. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
FRONT PAGE ABOVE THE FOLD, BUT IT SHOULD AT LEAST WARRANT A STORY IN THE
LOCAL MEDIA.

STEP SEVEN:

WRITE IN THE CODE 40 AND CODE 20 OUTCOMES ON THE FORCE SHEET. THE CODE
20 EFFECT SHOULD BE A MEASURABLE STEP TOWARDS THE CODE N OUTCOME, AND
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE NOTICED BY THE WORLD (AND LIKELY THE PLAYERS'
CHARACTERS). THE CODE 40 EFFECT SHOULD EITHER BE A MEASURABLE STEP
TOWARDS THE CODE N OUTCOME, OR A MEASURABLE STEP TOWARDS THE CODE 20
OUTCOME. THIS SHOULD ALSO BE SOMETHING NOTICED BY THE WORLD, AND WILL
LIKELY BE THE CHARACTERS FIRST HINTS AT THE FORCE'S OUTCOME.

STEP EIGHT:

IF YOU HAVE USED UP EACH STRESSOR FROM YOUR INITIAL LIST, YOU'RE DONE!
OTHERWISE, RETURN TO STEP 1

SPECIAL FORCES
--------------

THERE ARE TWO OTHER TYPES OF FORCES FOR THE MC TO KEEP TRACK OF, AND
THEY REPRESENT OTHER CRUCIAL PARTS OF THE WORLD. THEY ALSO HAVE FEWER
PARTS TO THEM THAN THE OTHER FORCES AND SHOULD BE EASIER TO KEEP TRACK
OF. THE INTERNAL FORCES CONTAINS ANY RELATIONSHIPS THAT DON'T BELONG IN
OTHER FORCES, LIKE MANY ANCHORS, MEMBERS OF A CABAL, OR STUDENTS. THIS
ISN'T TO SAY THAT THOSE CHARACTERS MIGHT NOT FIND A HOME WITH ANOTHER
FORCE THOUGH, WHICH COULD LEAD TO INTERESTING CHOICES FOR ANY MAGES THAT
THEY'RE CLOSE TO. THE CONSENSUS FORCE REPRESENTS FORCE BEING EXERTED ON
THE LOCAL CONSENSUS, AND IS ALMOST ALWAYS IN CONTROL OF ONE OF THE OTHER
FORCES.

### THE INTERNAL FORCES

THE INTERNAL FORCES SHEET HAS SPACE FOR CAST AND A STATUS TRACK WITH NO
LABELS. THIS TRACK ADVANCES JUST LIKE ANY OTHERS, WHEN INTERACTING WITH
(OR PERHAPS NOT INTERACTING WITH) IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN A PLAYER
CHARACTER'S INTERNAL LIFE. WHEN THIS FORCE'S STATUS TRACK REACHES CODE
N, THE NEWSWORTHY EVENT DOESN'T NEED TO MAKE LOCAL NEWS, BUT IT SHOULD
BE A BIG DEAL TO AT LEAST ONE OF THE PLAYER CHARACTERS. WHICH ONE WILL
DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THE FICTION AT THE TIME.

### THE CONSENSUS FORCE

THE CONSENSUS FORCE SHEET HAS SPACE FOR THE FORCE(S) CURRENTLY IN
CONTROL, A STATUS TRACK, AND A SPACE FOR LISTING THE CONSENSUS SHIFT
THAT THE FORCE IN CONTROL WILL MAKE IF THE STATUS TRACK REACHES CODE N.
THIS CAN BE A SMALL CHANGE SUCH AS BELIEVING THAT SNOW IN LATE SPRING IS
ENTIRELY SEASONAL. IT COULD ALSO BE A LARGER CHANGE, SUCH AS BELIEVING
THAT LONG POINTY EARS ARE ENTIRELY NORMAL FOR HUMANS.

REVEALING, RETIRING, AND ADAPTING FORCES
----------------------------------------

CONSENSUS' RULES GIVE YOU AN INITIAL SET OF FORCES THAT SHOULD BE TIED
INTO THE PLAYERS' CHARACTERS IN INTERESTING WAYS. HOWEVER, GAMES SHIFT
AND ADAPT OVER TIME. SOMETIMES A FORCE WILL SIMPLY SEEM TO BE LESS
INTERESTING THAN EXPECTED, AND COME UP LESS AND LESS. THAT'S JUST FINE.
YOU CAN LET IT FADE FROM VIEW, MAYBE TO BRING BACK UP IF IT SEEMS
RELEVANT LATER, OR LET IT DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY.

FORCES CAN ALSO SOMETIMES BECOME RESOLVED. MAYBE THEIR CODE N OUTCOME
WAS REACHED AND THERE REALLY IS NO DIRECT FOLLOWUP. IF A FORCE CONCERNS
AN ANTI-MAGIC STORM COMING INTO BEING OVER THE CITY, THEN AT CODE N IT
HAS HIT, LEFT AN ANTI-MAGIC SHELL, AND THE STORM ITSELF ABATES. OR,
MAYBE THE PLAYERS' CHARACTERS STRUCK SUCH A MAJOR BLOW AGAINST A FRONT
THAT THEY FULLY WITHDRAW FOR A WHILE. KEEP THEM IN MIND IN CASE IT MAKES
SENSE TO COME BACK, ESPECIALLY IF MEMBERS OF THE CAST ARE STILL AROUND
AND ALIVE, BUT IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO STOP CHOOSING THEM AS
ELEMENTS OF SCENES AND SOURCES OF MOVES.

YOU MAY WISH TO ADD FORCES AS THE GAME PROGRESSES. THIS CAN BE BECAUSE
SOMETHING NEW IS RECOGNIZED IN THE WORLD. MAYBE THE PLAYERS KEEP
REFERENCING AN ABANDONED HOUSE THAT THEY THINK IS HAUNTED. SURE, IF THE
GAME ISN'T TOO BUSY, WRITE IT UP AS A FORCE. CHOOSE A STRESSOR TO BASE
IT OFF OF THAT YOU THINK COULD USE MORE EXPLORING. IT ALSO CAN HAPPEN IF
YOU RESOLVE ONE OR MORE FORCES AND ARE STARTING TO FIND THAT THE GAME IS
GETTING A BIT THIN. IN THAT CASE, YOU CAN DEVELOP A NEW FORCE TO BRING
INTO PLAY BASED ON CHARACTERS' STRESSORS THAT AREN'T GETTING TO BE SEEN
MUCH, AND ON WORLD DETAILS THAT ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED. THIS IS A GREAT
PLACE TO HAVE A RIVAL SECT OF MAGES ROLL INTO TOWN, OR HAVE A
HITHERTO-UNNOTICED SECRET SOCIETY REVEAL ITSELF, OR HAVE A CHARACTER
WANDER IN NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY HAVE UNLEASHED. FOR ANY OF THESE, BUILD
THE FORCE SIMILARLY TO HOW YOU DID THE INITIAL ONES, BUT NOW YOU WILL
HAVE MUCH MORE FAMILIARITY WITH THE CHARACTERS AND THE FICTION TO FIT
THEM IN. DON'T FORGET TO MAKE THEIR GOALS AT CROSS PURPOSES WITH OTHER
FORCES, WHERE APPLICABLE.

FINALLY, IT IS REASONABLE TO CHANGE DETAILS OF A FORCE FROM TIME TO
TIME. CHANGING TRULY CORE ELEMENTS LIKE THE NAME OR STRESSOR PROBABLY
REPRESENT RETIRING THE FORCE AND BRINGING IN A NEW ONE AT THE SAME TIME,
BUT OTHER ASPECTS CAN CHANGE WITH PLAY. IN PARTICULAR, THE STATUS
TRACK'S LABELED CODES MAY ALTER AS YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FORCE, THE
FICTION, AND THE CHARACTERS. PERHAPS YOUR INITIAL IDEA SEEMS LESS
INTERESTING ONCE YOU SEE WHAT KIND OF GAME IS ACTUALLY BEING PLAYED. OR,
PERHAPS THE PLAYERS' CHARACTERS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY HAVE A BIG ENOUGH
IMPACT ON THE FORCE TO CHANGE THEIR GOALS. A FORCE SEEKING TO RESTRICT
KNOWLEDGE OF MAGIC USED FOR TIME TRAVEL WHICH IS MADE AWARE THAT THERE
ARE A NEARBY SECT OF TIME TRAVELLERS CASUALLY VISITING THE DISTANT PAST
ON A REGULAR BASIS MIGHT COMPLETELY SHIFT THEIR GOALS TO CONTAINING AND
NEUTRALIZING THE THREAT TO THE TIMELINE, AND SO UPDATE THEIR STATUS
TRACK ACCORDINGLY. CONVERSELY, A FORCE MAY TAKE SUCH A BLOW THAT THEY
HAVE TO COMPLETELY CHANGE TACTICS, WHICH ALSO CAN MEAN A MAJOR REWRITE.

THE CAST OF A FORCE CAN CONSTANTLY BE IN FLUX, AS NEW CHARACTERS WHO ARE
MEMBERS ARE ESTABLISHED, AND AS OLD ONES MAY LEAVE THE AREA, CHANGE
ALLEGIANCES, OR EVEN BE RENDERED PERMANENTLY INEFFECTUAL.

MOVES USUALLY SHOULDN'T CHANGE, SINCE THEY ARE CORE TO THE FORCE. YOU
MIGHT ADD MORE FROM THE APPROPRIATE STRESSOR'S LIST, IF YOU HAVE LESS
THAN THREE WRITTEN DOWN AND DISCOVER A NEW ONE THAT MAKES SENSE. THE
MOVES ALSO MIGHT CHANGE DURING A MAJOR EVENT, SUCH AS THE FORCE HITTING
CODE N. IN THE RECONFIGURING THAT HAPPENS AS A NEW GOAL IS SELECTED, OLD
CAPABILITIES MAY BE ABANDONED OR MADE IRRELEVANT, AND THEY MAY SEEK OR
DISCOVER NEW METHODS.
