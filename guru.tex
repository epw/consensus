      surplus and a want. On a 6-, they will do everything in their
      power to satisfy all their wants.}

      action} for considerable time, roll +Wits. On a 10+ hold 3, on a
    7-9 hold 1. You may spend this hold 1-for-1 at any time to ask the
    GM a question from this list, the GM will answer truthfully. You
    take +1 forward when acting on this information.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item What's my escape route? 
    \item What are the unknowable risks?

    Demonstrating Magical Superiority}
  \MOVE{What you Need, not what you Want}{When another character comes
    to you for advice and you \TRIGGER{tell them honestly what you
