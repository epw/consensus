      surplus and a want. On a 6-, they will do everything in their
      power to satisfy all their wants.}

      action} for considerable time, roll +Dynamic. On a 10+ hold 3, on a

    MC a question from this list, the MC will answer truthfully. You
    take +1 forward when acting on this information.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item What's my escape route? 
    \item What are the unknowable risks?
    \item Where can the Consensus be bent in my favor?

    impressing a non-Mage magical being in order to sway them.}
  \MOVE{What you Need, not what you Want}{When another character comes
    to you for advice and you \TRIGGER{tell them honestly what you
      think the best course of action is}, they take +1 ongoing while
    following your advice, and you mark experience.}
