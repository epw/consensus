moment

Whether it is present in a scene or not, your Source always counts as an active Inspiration for you.

**Just When I Think You're Gone:** When you **pass up an opportunity to interact with your Source**, or remove it from a scene, roll +Within. On a hit, hold 1. On a 10+ you may spend your hold 1-for-1 to have your source appear in the scene with no explanation needed.

The MC will make your prediction come true, if it’s even remotely possible. On a miss, take -1 ongoing until the chaos subsides.

You also have this move:

When you and another character **exchange a moment of humanity**, roll +Entropic. On a hit you count as having Opened Their Mind, as if you’d rolled a 10+. On a 7-9 they hold 1, and can spend that hold to have your Source show up in a scene, or deny it from you for a scene. On a 6-, if they are aware of the magical world, they gain a Restriction against magic with your Source.
