## How to Make a Force out of A Stressor

Step one:

Sit down with your list of stressors from the first session. Pick one of them. Then, pick a force type that compliments it.

Step two:

Write down anything you already know about this Force. For example, you might know some of its cast because they were named in the first session. You might know the name of the Force if that came up. The only things you absolutely should not fill in during this step are the Moves and the Countdown Steps. These will come during later steps.

Step three:

Choose a Type for this Force, and then choose one of the subtypes from the list below.

Organization

* Dogmatic (impulse: enforce some truth on the local area)

* Expansionist (Impulse: grow and gain members)

* Acquisitive (impulse: gain resources or knowledge)

* Vigilant (impulse: stand together and defend each other)

Outsider

* Wild (impulse: to return something to its natural state)

* Tricky (impulse: to beguile, lure in, and toy with victims)

* Corrupting (impulse: to invert a being’s desires)

* Ephemeral (impulse: to become more real)

* Destructive (impulse: to consume, raze, and damage)

Aspirant

* Power (impulse: to steal power from those who have it)

* Secrets (impulse: to learn a dangerous secret)

* Taboo (impulse: to do something no one would do)

* Revenge (impulse: to exact revenge on someone who has wronged them)

* Entropy (impulse: to return things to lower states of energy)

Place of Power

* Cursed(impulse: to draw in new victims)

* Wild (impulse: to grow)

* Dedicated (impulse: to reduce control)

* Convergent (impulse: to be used)

* Hidden (impulse: to be found)

Artifact

* Powerful (impulse: to overwhelm the user)

* Destructive (impulse: to cause collateral damage)

* Knowledgable (impulse: to reveal something better left hidden)

* Cursed (impulse: to spread the curse)

* Broken (impulse: to be repaired)

Step four:

Choose up to three Force moves from the stressor that this Force is based on. The Force Moves are listed below.

Step five:

If you have not named the Force, do so now. Likewise fill in any cast that are likely to come up right away. Write a brief description of the Force, and how it interacts with the world (ie the player’s characters and the other Forces)

Step six:

Look at the impulse from the type this Force is based on, and write down a Code N outcome for the Force. These are broad categories, so narrow it down and make it specific to the Force you’ve built. This represents what happens when the Force progresses its goals or is left unchecked, and the effect it will have on the world. Since this is Code N on a status track, make sure it is a Newsworthy Event. It doesn’t have to be front page above the fold, but it should at least warrant a story in the local media.

Step seven:

Write in the Code 40 and Code 20 Outcomes on the Force sheet. The Code 20 effect should be a measurable step towards the Code N Outcome, and something that would be noticed by the world (and likely the players’ characters). The Code 40 effect should either be a measurable step towards the Code N Outcome, or a measurable step towards the Code 20 Outcome. This should also be something noticed by the world, and will likely be the characters first hints at the Force’s Outcome. 

Step eight:

If you have used up each Stressor from your initial list, you’re done! Otherwise, return to step 1

## Special Forces

There are two other types of Forces for the MC to keep track of, and they represent other crucial parts of the world. They also have fewer parts to them than the other Forces and should be easier to keep track of. The Internal Forces contains any relationships that don’t belong in other forces, like many Anchors, members of a Cabal, or Students. This isn’t to say that those characters might not find a home with another Force though, which could lead to interesting choices for any mages that they’re close to. The Consensus Force represents force being exerted on the local Consensus, and is almost always in control of one of the other Forces.

### The Internal Forces

The Internal Forces sheet has space for cast and a status track with no labels. This track advances just like any others, when interacting with (or perhaps not interacting with) important people in a player character’s internal life. When this Force’s status track reaches Code N, the newsworthy event doesn’t need to make local news, but it should be a Big Deal to at least one of the player characters. Which one will depend entirely on the fiction at the time.

### The Consensus Force
